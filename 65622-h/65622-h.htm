<p>Twenty months have elapsed since the Introductory
Lecture was published in <span class="smcap">The Lancet</span>; fifteen others
succeeded at intervals, and fifteen have been printed separately
to complete the number of which the present work
is composed. Divested of the historical and argumentative,
as well as of much of the illustrative part, contained
in the records whence it is derived, it nevertheless occupies
585 pages&mdash;the essential points therein being numbered
from 1 to 423.</p>

<p>Sir De Lacy Evans, in some observations lately made
in the House of Commons on the subject of a Professorship
of Military Surgery in London, alluded to these
Lectures in the most gratifying manner; he could not,
however, state their origin, scope, or object, being unacquainted
with them.</p>

<p>On the termination of the war in 1814, I expressed in
print my regret that we had not had another battle in
the south of France, to enable me to decide two or three
points in surgery which were doubtful. I was called an
enthusiast, and laughed at accordingly. The battle of
Waterloo afforded the desired opportunity. Sir James
M’Grigor, then first appointed Director-General, offered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
place me on full pay for six months. This would have
been destructive to my prospects in London; I therefore
offered to serve for three, which he was afraid would be
called a job, although the difference between half-pay and
full was under sixty pounds; and our amicable discussion
ended by my going to Brussels and Antwerp for five weeks
as an amateur. The officers in both places received me
in a manner to which I cannot do justice. They placed
themselves and their patients at my entire disposal, and
carried into effect every suggestion. The doubts on the
points alluded to were dissipated, and the principles wanting
were established. Three of the most important cases,
which had never before been seen in London nor in Paris,
were sent to the York Military Hospital, then at Chelsea.
The rank I held as a Deputy Inspector-General precluded
my being employed. It was again a matter of money. I
offered to do the duty of a staff-surgeon without pay, provided
two wards were assigned to me in which the worst
cases from Brussels and Antwerp might be collected. The
offer was accepted; and for two years I did this duty,
until the hospital was broken up, and the men transferred
to Chatham. In the first year a Course of Lectures on
Military Surgery was given. The inefficiency of such a
Course alone was soon seen, for Surgery admits of no
such distinctions. Injuries of the head, for instance, in
warfare, usually take place on the sides and vertex; in
civil life, more frequently at the base. They implicate
each other so inseparably, although all the symptoms are
not alike or always present, that they cannot be disconnected
with propriety. This equally obtains in other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
parts; and my second and extended Course was recognized
by the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons
as one of General Surgery.</p>

<p>When the Court of Examiners of the Royal College of
Surgeons of England&mdash;of which body I have been for
more than twenty years a humble member&mdash;confer their
diploma after examination on a student, they do not consider
him to have done more than laid the foundation for
that knowledge which is to be afterward acquired by
long and patient observation. When a student in law
is called to the bar, he is not supposed to be therefore
qualified to be a Queen’s counsel, much less a judge or a
chancellor. The young theologian, admitted into deacon’s
orders, is not supposed to be fitted for a bishopric. When
the young surgeon is sent, in the execution of his duties,
to distant climes, where he has few and sometimes no opportunities
of adding to the knowledge he had previously
acquired, it is apt to be impaired; and he may return to
England, after an absence of several years, less qualified,
perhaps, than when he left it. To such persons a course
of instruction is invaluable. It should be open to them
as public servants gratuitously, and should be conveyed
by a person appointed and paid by the Crown. He
should be styled, in my opinion, the Military Professor
of Surgery, and be capable, from his previous experience
and his civil opportunities, of teaching all things in the
principles and practice of surgery connected with his office,
although he may and should annually select his subjects.
Leave of absence for three months might be advantageously
granted to officers in turn for the purpose of
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>tending
these lectures, and the Professor should certify as
to their time having been well employed. For thirty
years I endeavored to render this service to the Army,
the Navy, and the East India Company, from the knowledge
I had acquired of its importance. To the Officers
of these services my two hospitals, together with Lectures
and Demonstrations, were always open gratuitously, as a
mark of the estimation in which I held them. By the
end of that period the enthusiasm of the enthusiast who
wished for another battle in 1814 had oozed out, like the
courage of Bob Acres in “The Rivals,” at the ends of
his fingers. The course of instruction was discontinued,
but not until such parts were printed, under the title of
“Records of the Surgery of the War,” as were not before
the public, in order that teachers of civil or systematic
surgery should be acquainted with them.</p>

<p>The rapid sale of the fifth, and the demand for a sixth
edition of this work, enable me to say that the precepts
inculcated in it have been fully borne out and confirmed
by the practice of the Surgeons of the Army now in the
Crimea in almost every particular. To several of these
gentlemen I desire to offer my warmest thanks for the
assistance they have afforded. Their names are given with
the cases and observations they have been so good as to
send me, and a fuller “Addenda” shall be made from time
to time, as I receive further information from them, and
others who will, I hope, follow the example they have thus
set. More, however, has been done; they have performed
operations of the gravest importance at my suggestion, that
had not been done before, with a judgment and ability beyond
all praise; and they have modified others to the great
advantage of those who may hereafter suffer from similar
injuries. They have thus proved that if the Administrative
duties of the Medical Department of the Army have not
been free from public animadversion, that its practical and
scientific duties have merited public approbation; which I
am satisfied, from what they have already done, they will
continue to deserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
The precepts laid down are the result of the experience
acquired in the war in the Peninsula, from the first battle
of Roliça in 1808, to the last in Belgium, of Waterloo in
1815, which altered, nay overturned, nearly all those which
existed previously to that period, on all points to which
they relate. Points as essential in the Surgery of domestic
as in military life. They have been the means of saving
the lives, and of relieving, if not even of preventing, the
miseries of thousands of our fellow-creatures throughout
the civilized world.</p>

<p>I would willingly imitate the example lately indulged in,
by many of the best Parisian surgeons, of detailing circumstantially
the improvements they have made in practical
and scientific surgery; the manner in which they were at
first contested, and the universal adoption of them which
has succeeded, were it not that I might run the risk of
being accused of gratifying some personal vanity, while
only desirous of drawing the attention of the public to the
merits of the men who so ably served them in the last war,
nearly all of whom are no more; and who have passed
away, as I trust their successors will not, with scarcely a
single acknowledgment of their services, except the humble
tribute now offered by their companion and friend.</p>

<p class="h2sub">ON GUNSHOT WOUNDS, ETC.</p>

<p>1. A wound made by a musket-ball is essentially contused,
and attended by more or less pain, according to the
sensibility of the sufferer, and the manner in which he may
be engaged at the moment of injury. A musket-ball will
often pass through a fleshy part, causing only the sensation
of a sudden and severe, although sometimes of a trifling
blow. If it merely strike the same part without rupturing
the skin, the pain is often great. Major King, of the Fusiliers,
was killed at New Orleans by a musket-ball, which
struck him on the pit of the stomach, leaving only the mark
of a contusion.</p>

<p>2. Wounds from musket-balls, particularly of the face,
sometimes bleed considerably at the moment of injury, and
for some little time afterward, although no large vessel
shall be injured to render the bleeding inconvenient or dangerous.
The application of a tourniquet is then seldom if
ever necessary, unless a vessel of some magnitude should be
partially torn or divided.</p>

<p>3. When a limb is carried away by a cannon-shot, any
destructive bleeding usually ceases with the faintness and
failure of strength subsequent on the shock, and a hemorrhage
thus spontaneously suppressed does not generally
return; it is the effort of nature to save life. The application
of a tourniquet is rarely necessary, unless as a
precau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>tionary
measure, when it should be applied loosely, and the
patient, or some one else, shown how to tighten it if necessary.
A musket-ball will often pass so close to a large
artery, without injuring it, as to lead to the belief that the
vessel must have receded from the ball by its elasticity. A
ball passed between the femoral artery and vein of a soldier
at Toulouse without doing more injury than a contusion, but
it gave rise to inflammation and closure of the vessels, followed
by gangrene of the extremity. General Sir Lowry
Cole was shot through the body at Salamanca, immediately
below the left clavicle; a part of the first rib came away,
and the artery at the wrist became, and remained, much
diminished in size. General Sir Edward Packenham was
shot through the neck on two different occasions, the track
of each wound being apparently through the great vessels.
The first wound gave him a curve in his neck, the second
made it straight. His last unfortunate wound, at New
Orleans, was directly through the common iliac artery, and
killed him on the spot. Colonel Duckworth, of the 48th
Regiment, received a ball through the edge of his leather
stock, at Albuhera, which divided the carotid artery, and
killed him almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>4. Secondary hemorrhage of any importance from small
vessels does not <i>often</i> occur. On the separation of the contused
parts, or sloughs, a little blood may be occasionally
lost; but it is then generally caused by the impatience of
the surgeon, or the irregularity of the patient, and seldom
requires attention.</p>

<p>5. A large artery does sometimes give way by ulceration
between the eighth and the twentieth days; but the proportion
is not more than four cases in a thousand, requiring
the application of a ligature; exclusive of those formidable
injuries caused by broken bones, or the inordinate sloughing
caused by hospital gangrene, when not properly treated.</p>

<p>6. A certain constitutional alarm or shock follows every
serious wound, the continuance of which excites a suspicion
of its dangerous nature, which nothing but its subsidence,
and the absence of symptoms peculiar to the internal part
presumed to be injured, should remove. The opinion given
under such circumstances should be very guarded; for if
this symptom of alarm should continue, great fears may be
entertained of hidden mischief. Colonel Sir W. Myers was
shot, at Albuhera, at the head of the Fusilier Brigade, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the moment of victory, by a musket-ball, which broke his
thigh, and lodged. The continuance of the alarm and
anxiety satisfied me it had done other mischief. He died
next morning, of mortification of the intestines. General
Sir Robert Crawford was wounded at the foot of the smaller
breach at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo, by a musket-ball,
which entered the outer and back part of the shoulder,
and came out at the axilla. There was a third wound, a
small slit in the side, apparently too small to admit a ball.
The continuance of the anxiety and alarm pointed out some
hidden mischief, which I declared had taken place; and
when he died his surgeon found the ball loose in his chest.
It had been rolling about on his diaphragm. Surgery was
not sufficiently advanced in those days to point out the situation,
or to authorize an attempt for the removal of the ball.
It must in future be done.</p>

<p>This constitutional alarm and derangement are not always
present to so marked an extent. A soldier at Talavera was
struck on the head by a twelve-pound shot, which drove
some bone into, and some brain out of his head: he was
walking about, complaining but little, immediately after the
accident, although he died subsequently.</p>

<p>7. It is not always possible, from their appearance, to
decide which opening is the entrance, which the exit of an
ordinary sized round ball; or when two holes are distant
from each other, to ascertain whether they have been caused
by one, or by two distinct balls. When a ball is not impinging
with much impetus, it may become a penetrating, without
being much of a contused wound, which will close in and
heal with little suppuration. If the ball do not press upon,
or interfere with some important part, the slight degree of
irritation which follows may give rise to the formation of a
sac, which adheres to it and possibly keeps it quiet for years,
if not for life.</p>

<p>8. The wound made by the entrance of an ordinary musket-ball
is usually circular, depressed, of a livid color, and
capable of admitting the little finger, the exit being more
ragged, and not depressed. It is sometimes little more than
a small slit or rent, although at others, as in the face or in
the back of the hand, it may be much torn, giving to an
otherwise simple wound a more frightful appearance, such
as is not usually seen in the thigh, or other equally firm
fleshy part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
9. Wounds from flattened or irregular-shaped musket-balls,
pieces of shells, or other sharp-edged destructive
instruments, are often very much lacerated, and their entrance
is less marked. The part thus torn can generally
be preserved, and the wound healed with comparatively
little loss of substance.</p>

<p>10. When it is desirable to ascertain the exact course of
a ball, and, if possible, the internal part injured by it, the
sufferer should be placed in the position he was in when he
received the injury, with especial reference to the probable
situation of the enemy, when that will often become very
intelligible which was before indistinct. My attention was
directed, after the battle of Toulouse, to a soldier, whose
foot was gangrenous without an apparent cause, he having
received merely a flesh wound in the thigh, not in the exact
course of the main artery, which, nevertheless, I said was
injured. On placing the man in the same position with regard
to us, that he supposed himself to have been in toward
the enemy when wounded, the possibility of such an injury
was seen; and dissection after death proved the correctness
of the opinion.</p>

<p>11. When one opening only can be seen, it is presumed
the ball has lodged; but this does not follow, although the
finger of the surgeon may pass into the wound for some distance.
At the battle of Vimiera, I pulled a piece of shirt,
with a ball at the bottom of it, out of the thigh of an officer
of the 40th Regiment, into which it had gone for at least
three inches. After the battle of Toulouse, a ball, which
penetrated the surface of the chest, and passed under the
pectoral muscle for two inches, was ejected by the elasticity
of the rib against which it struck. Scarcely any inconvenience
followed, and the officer rapidly recovered. After
the battle of Waterloo, I was requested to decide whether a
young officer should be allowed to die in a few days, or to
have a chance for his life by losing his leg above the knee.
The joint was open, the suppuration profuse. A large or
grape-shot was supposed to be lodged in the head of the
tibia. The limb was amputated, and he is now alive, forty
years afterward, but no shot was found in his limb. It had
dropped out after doing the injury.</p>

<p>12. The treatment of simple gunshot or flesh wounds
should be, under ordinary circumstances, as simple as themselves.
Nothing should be applied but a piece of linen or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lint, wetted with cold water; this may be retained by a strip
of sticking-plaster, or any other thing applicable for the purpose
of keeping the injured part covered. A compress of
linen, or other similar substance, moistened with cold or iced
water when procurable, will be useful; and a few inches of
a linen bandage may be sewed on, to prevent the compress
from changing its position during sleep. When the wound
becomes tender, a little oil, lard, or simple ointment may be
placed over it. A roller, as a surgical application, is useless,
if not injurious. At the first and second battles in
Portugal, every wound had a roller applied over it; it soon
became stiff, bloody, and dirty. They did no good, were for
the most part cut off with scissors, and thus rendered useless.
When really wanted, at a later period, they were not forthcoming.
An advancing army cannot, and ought not to carry
casks full of rollers into the field; and the apothecary-general
had better have instead, two casks or boxes full of good
wax candles; for, although every regimental surgeon ought
to have four in his panniers, kept as carefully for emergencies
as his capital instruments, they will require from time
to time to be replaced. No roller should be more than two
inches and a quarter wide, and made of good, strong, coarse
linen, very much, in fact, the reverse of the rollers which
have until lately been supplied to the army.</p>

<p>13. Cold or iced water may be used as long as cold is
grateful to the sufferer. When it ceases to be so, it should
be exchanged for warm, applied in any convenient way which
modern improvements have suggested, whether by piline,
gutta-percha, oiled silk, etc. An evaporating poultice may
be used in private life, but no poultices should be permitted
in a military hospital, until the principal surgeon is satisfied
they are necessary. They are generally cloaks for negligence,
and sure precursors of amputation in all serious injuries
of bones and joints. They are properly used to alleviate
pain, stiffness, swelling, the uneasiness arising from cold, and
to encourage the commencing or impeded action of the vessels
toward the formation of matter. As soon as the effect
intended has been obtained, the poultice should be abandoned,
and recourse again had to water, hot or cold, with
compress and bandage. I was in the habit of calling a
poultice when misapplied a <i>cover-slut</i>.</p>

<p>14. Many simple flesh wounds are cured in four weeks;
the greater part in six. Fresh air and cold water are
essen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>tial.
Purgatives may be occasionally given, and abstinence
is an excellent remedy. Emetics, bleeding, and something
approaching to starvation as to solids, are of great importance
if the sufferers should be irregular in their habits, or
the inflammatory symptoms run high. In weakly persons,
a generous diet with tonic remedies will be necessary.</p>

<p>15. In wounds of muscular parts inflammation usually
occurs from twelve to twenty-four hours after the injury,
and the vicinity of the wound becomes more sensible to the
touch, with a little swelling and increase of discoloration.
A reddish serous fluid is discharged, and the limb becomes
stiff and nearly incapable of motion, from its causing an
increase of pain. These symptoms are gradually augmented
on or about the third day; the inflammation surrounding
the wound is more marked; the discharge is altered, being
thicker; the action of the absorbents on the edges of the
wound may be observed; and, on the fourth or fifth, the
line of separation between the dead and living parts will be
very evident. The wound will now discharge purulent matter
mixed with other fluids, which gradually diminish as the
naturally healthy actions take place. The inside of the
wound, as the process of separation proceeds, changes from
a blackish-red color to a brownish yellow, moistened by a
little good pus. On the fifth and sixth days, the outer edge
of the separating slough is distinctly marked, and begins to
be displaced; the surrounding inflammation extends to some
distance, the parts are more painful and sensible to the
touch; the discharge is more purulent, but not great in
quantity. On the eighth or ninth day, the slough is, in
most cases, separated from the edges of the track of the
ball, and hanging in the mouth of the wound, although it
cannot yet be disengaged; the discharge increases, and the
wound becomes less painful to the patient, although frequently
more sensible when touched.</p>

<p>If there be two openings, the exit of the ball, or the
counter-opening, is in general much the cleaner, being often
in a fair granulating state before the entrance of the ball is
free from slough. If the inflammation have been smart, the
limb is at this time a little swollen and discolored for some
distance around; fibrin and serum are thrown out into the
cellular membrane, or areolar tissue, as it is now termed;
the redness diminishes; the sloughs are discharged, together
with any little extraneous substances which may be in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wound; and there is frequently a slight bleeding, if the irritable
granulations are roughly treated. The limb on the
twelfth, and even fifteenth day, retains the appearance of
yellowness and discoloration which ensues from a bruise,
and which continues a few days longer. The sloughs do
not, sometimes, separate until this period, and, in persons
slow to action, not even until a later one. The wound now
contracts; the middle portion of the track first closes, and
is no longer pervious; the lower opening soon heals, while
the upper, or that usually made by the entrance of the ball,
continues to discharge for some time, and toward the end
of six weeks, or sometimes two months, finally heals with a
depression and cicatrix, marking distinctly the nature of the
injury that has been received.</p>

<p>16. The state of constitution, the difficulties and distresses
of military warfare, exposure to the inclemency of
the weather, the season of the year, or the imprudence of
individuals, will sometimes bring on a train of serious symptoms,
in wounds apparently of the same nature as others in
which no such evils occur. After the first two or three
days, the symptoms gradually increase, the swelling is much
augmented, the redness extends, and the pain is more severe
and constant. The wound becomes dry, stiff, with glistening
edges, the general sensibility is increased, the system
sympathizes, the skin becomes hot and dry, the tongue
loaded, the head aches, the patient is restless and uneasy,
the pulse full and quick; there is fever of the inflammatory
kind. The swelling of the part increases from deposition in
the areolar tissue to a considerable extent above and below
the wound, and the inflammation, instead of being entirely
superficial or confined to the immediate track of the ball,
spreads widely. The wound itself the sufferer can hardly
bear to be touched; it discharges but little, and the sloughs
separate slowly. Pus soon begins to be secreted more copiously,
not only in the track of the wound, but in the surrounding
parts; sinuses may form in the course of the muscles,
or under the fascia, and considerable surgical treatment
be necessary, while the cure is protracted from three to four,
and even to six months; and is often attended for a longer
period with lameness, from contraction of the muscles or
adhesions of the areolar tissue. The parts, from having
been so long in a state of inflammation, are much weaker,
and if the injury have been in the lower extremity, the leg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and foot swell on any exertion, which cannot be performed
without pain and inconvenience for a considerable time.
The treatment should be active; the patient, if robust,
ought to be bled if no endemic disease prevail, vomited,
purged, kept in the recumbent position, and cold applied
so long as it shall be found agreeable to his feelings; when
that ceases to be the case, warm fomentations ought to be
resorted to, but they are to be abandoned the instant the
inflammation is subdued and suppuration well established.
The feelings of the patient will determine the period, and it
is better to begin a day too soon than one too late. If the
inflammation be superficial, leeches will not be of the same
utility as when it is deep seated; but then they must be
applied in much greater numbers than are usually recommended.
The roller and graduated compresses, or pressure
made by slips of adhesive plaster under them, are the best
means of cure in the subsequent stages, with change of air,
and friction to the whole extremity, which alone, when early
and well applied, will often save months of tedious treatment.
If the limb become contracted and the cellular membrane
thickened, it is principally by friction (shampooing)
that it can be restored to its natural motion.</p>

<p>17. If the ball should have penetrated without making
an exit, or have carried in with it any extraneous substances,
the surgeon must, if possible, ascertain its exact
situation, and remove it and any foreign bodies which may
be lodged; indeed, if there be time, every wound should
be examined so strictly as to enable the surgeon to satisfy
himself that nothing has lodged. This is less necessary
where there are two corresponding openings evidently belonging
to one shot; but it is imperiously demanded of
the surgeon, where there is one opening only, even if that
be so much lacerated as to lead to the suspicion of its being
a rent from a piece of shell; for it is by no means uncommon
for such missiles, or a grape-shot, to lodge wholly
unknown to the patient, and to be discovered by the surgeon
at a subsequent period, when much time has been lost
and misery endured. A soldier during the siege of Badajoz
had the misfortune to be near a shell at the moment of its
bursting, and was so much mangled as to render it necessary
to remove one leg, an arm, and a testicle, (a part of
the penis and scrotum being lost.) In one of the flesh wounds
in the back part of the thigh and buttock a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
piece of shell was lodged, and kept op considerable irritation
until it was removed. The man recovered.</p>

<p>18. In examining a wound, a finger should be gently introduced,
if possible, in the course of the ball, to its utmost
extent; in parts connected with life, or liable to be seriously
injured, it is the only sound usually admissible. While this
examination is taking place, the hand of the surgeon should
be carefully pressed upon the part opposite where the ball
may be expected to lie, by which means it may perhaps be
brought within reach of the finger, and for want of which
precaution, it may be missed by a very trifling distance.
While the finger is in the wound the limb may be thrown as
nearly as possible into that action which was about to be
performed on the receipt of the injury, when the contraction
of the muscles and the relative change of the parts will
more readily allow the course of the ball to be followed.
If this should fail, attention should be paid to the various
actions of the limb, the attendant symptoms arising from
parts affected, and what may be called the general anatomy
of the whole circle of injury. A muscle, in the act of contraction,
may oppose an obstacle to the passage of an instrument
in the direction the ball has taken, especially if it
should have passed between tendons or surfaces loosely connected
by cellular membrane; as by the side of, or between
the great blood-vessels, which by their elasticity may make
way for the ball, and yet impede the progress of a sound.
When the ball is ascertained to have passed beyond the
reach of the finger, a blunt silver sound or elastic bougie
may be used, and the opposite side of the limb should be
carefully examined, and pressure made on the wounded side,
when it will probably be found more or less deeply seated.
If the ball should not be discoverable by these means, the
surgeon should consider every symptom, and every part of
anatomy connected with the wound, before he decides on
leaving the ball to the operations of nature.</p>

<p>19. It is unnecessary to dilate a wound without a precise
object in view, which might render an additional opening
requisite. This dilatation or opening, when made, should
always be carried through the fascia of the limb. A wound
ought not to be dilated because such operation may at a
more distant period become necessary. The necessity should
first be seen, when the operation follows of course.</p>

<p>Suppose a man be brought for assistance with a wound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
through the thigh, in the immediate vicinity of the femoral
artery, which he says bled considerably at the moment of
injury, but the hemorrhage had ceased. Is the surgeon
warranted in cutting down upon the artery, and putting
ligatures upon it on suspicion? Every man in his senses
ought to answer, No. The surgeon should take the precaution
of applying a tourniquet loosely on the limb, and
of placing the man in a situation where he can receive constant
attention in case of need; but he is not authorized to
proceed to any operation, unless another bleeding should
demonstrate the injury and the necessity for suppressing it.
By the same reasoning, incisions are not to be made into the
thigh on the speculation that they may be hereafter required.
If the confusion which has enveloped this subject
be removed, and bleeding arteries, broken bones, and the
lodgment of extraneous substances be admitted to be the
only legitimate causes for dilating wounds in the first instance,
the arguments in favor of primary dilatation in other
cases must fall to the ground.</p>

<p>When the inflammation, pain, and fever run high, the
tension of the part being great, an incision should be made
by introducing the knife into the wound, and cutting for
the space of two or three inches, according to circumstances,
in the course of the muscles, carefully avoiding any other
parts of importance. The same should be done at the inferior
or opposite opening, if mischief be seriously impending,
not so much on the principle of loosening the fascia as
on that of taking away blood from the part immediately
affected, and of making a free opening for the evacuation
of the fluids about to be effused.</p>

<p>It is no less an advantageous practice in the subsequent
stages of gunshot wounds, where sinuses form and are
tardy in healing. A free incision is also very often serviceable
when parts are unhealthy, although there may not
be any considerable sinus. Upon the necessity of it where
bones are splintered, there is no occasion in this place to
insist.</p>

<p>20. In making incisions for the removal of balls in the
vicinity of large vessels, particularly in the neck, the hand
should always be unsupported, in order to prevent an accident
from any sudden movement of the patient. This
caution is the more necessary on the field of battle, where
many things may give rise to sudden alarm. At the affair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of Saca Parte, near Alfaiates, in Portugal, I stationed myself
behind a small watch-tower, and the wounded were first
brought to this spot for assistance. A howitzer had also
been placed upon it, being rising ground, and at the moment
I was extracting a ball situated immediately over the
carotid artery, the gun was fired, to the inexpressible alarm
of surgeon, patient, and orderly, who bolted in all directions.
From my hand being unsupported, no mischief ensued,
and the operation was completed as soon as all had
recovered their usual serenity. When a ball is discovered
on the opposite side of a limb, through which it has nearly
penetrated, but has not had sufficient power to overcome
the resistance and elasticity of the skin, it should be removed
by incision. An opening is thus obtained for the
evacuation of any matter which may be formed in the long
track of such a wound, and any other extraneous bodies are
more readily extracted. When a ball has penetrated half
through the thick part of the thigh, in such a direction that
it cannot readily be removed by the opening at which it
entered; or, from the vicinity of the great vessels, it may
be considered unadvisable to cut for it in that direction; or
if the ball cannot be distinctly felt by the finger through the
soft parts, it ought not to be sought for at the moment, for
an incision of considerable extent will be required to enable
the surgeon to extract it. Much pain will be caused, and
higher inflammation may follow than would ensue if the
wound were left to the efforts of nature alone, by which,
in time, the ball would in all probability be brought much
nearer to the surface, and might be more safely extracted.
It frequently happens, that after a few days or weeks, a ball
will be distinctly felt in a spot where the surgeon had before
searched for it in vain. A wound will frequently close
without further trouble, the ball remaining without inconvenience
in its new situation; and the patient not being
annoyed by it, does not feel disposed to submit to pain or
inconvenience for its removal. A very strong reason for the
extraction of balls during the first period of treatment, if it
can be safely accomplished, is, that they do not always remain
harmless, but frequently give rise to distressing or harassing
pains in or about the part, which often oblige the
sufferer to submit to their extraction at a later period, when
their removal is infinitely more difficult; and may be more
distressing than at the moment of injury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Nothing appears more simple than to cut out a ball which
can be felt at the distance of an inch, or even half an inch
below the skin, but the young surgeon often finds it more
difficult than he expected, because he makes his incision too
small; and cannot at all times oppose sufficient resistance to
prevent the ball from retreating before the effort he makes
for its expulsion with the forceps or other instrument. The
ball also requires to be cleared from the surrounding cellular
substance, to a greater extent than might at first be imagined;
for all that seems to be required is, that a simple
incision be made down to the surface of it, when it will slip
out, which is not usually the case. When a ball has been
lodged for years, a membranous kind of sac is formed around
it, which shuts it in as it were from all communication with
the surrounding parts. If it should become necessary to
extract a ball which has been lodged in this manner, the
membranous sac will often be found to adhere so strongly
to the ball that it cannot be got out without great difficulty,
and sometimes not without cutting out a portion of the adhering
sac.</p>

<p>It often occurs that a ball lodges and cannot be found,
especially where it has struck against a bone, and slanted
off in a different direction. If the ball should lodge in the
cellular tissue between two muscles, it often descends by its
gravity to a considerable distance, and excites a low degree
of irritation, which slowly brings it to the surface, or terminates
in abscess. Colonel Ross, of the Rifle Brigade, was
wounded at the battle of Waterloo by a musket-ball, which
entered at the upper part of the arm and injured the bone.
More than one surgeon had pointed out the way by which it
had passed under the scapula and lodged itself in some of
the muscles of the back. About a year afterward I extracted
it close to the elbow, the ball lying at the bottom of
an abscess, which was only brought near the surface by
time, by the use of flannel, and by desisting from all emollient
applications.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a>
Various instruments have been invented for the removal of
balls which have been deeply lodged in soft parts; but little assistance
has been derived from them hitherto, although many of them
are very ingenious.</p>

</div>

<p>21. A ball will frequently strike a bone, and lodge, without
causing a fracture, although it will a fissure. It will
even go through the lower part of the thigh-bone, between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
or a little above the condyles, merely splitting without separating
it, and some balls have lodged in bones for years,
with little inconvenience. It should nevertheless be a general
rule not to allow a ball to remain in a bone, if it can be
removed by any reasonable operation. The rule is not entirely
devoid of exception. Lieutenant-Colonel Dumaresq,
aid-de-camp to the present Lord Strafford, was wounded at
Waterloo by a ball which penetrated the right scapula, and
lodged in a rib in the axilla. The thoracic inflammation
nearly cost him his life, but he ultimately quite recovered,
and died many years afterward of apoplexy, the ball remaining
enveloped in bone.</p>

<p>22. When a bayonet is thrust into the body it is a punctured
wound made by direct pressure; when of little depth,
much inconvenience rarely ensues, and the part heals slowly,
but surely, under the precaution of daily pressure. A punctured
wound, extending to considerable depth, labors under
disadvantages in proportion to the smallness of the instrument,
and the differences of texture through which it passes.
When the instrument is large, the opening made is in proportion,
and does not afford so great an obstacle to the
discharge of the fluids poured out or secreted as when the
opening is small. Lance wounds are therefore less dangerous
than those inflicted by the bayonet. When a small
instrument passes deep through a fascia, it makes an opening
in it which is not increased by the natural retraction of
parts, inasmuch as it is not sufficiently large to admit of it;
and which opening, small as it is, may be filled or closed up
by the soft cellular tissue below, which rises into it, and
forms a barrier to the discharge of any matter which may
be secreted beneath. If the instrument should have passed
into a muscle, it is evident that if that muscle were in a
state of contraction at the moment of injury, the punctured
part must be removed to a certain distance from the direct
line of the wound when in a state of relaxation, and vice
versa. The matter, secreted, and more or less in almost
every instance will be secreted, cannot in either case make
its escape, and all the symptoms occur of a spontaneous
abscess deeply seated below a fascia. That inflammation
should spread in a continuous texture is not uncommon;
that matter, when confined, should give rise to great constitutional
disturbance is, if possible, less so; but that this
disturbance takes place without the occurrence of
inflamma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>tion,
or the formation of matter, may be doubted; and it
may be concluded that there is no peculiarity in punctured
wounds that may not be accounted for in a satisfactory
manner. Serious effects have been attributed to injuries of
nerves, but without sufficient reason; nevertheless, those
who have seen locked-jaw follow a very simple scratch of
the leg from a musket-ball, more frequently than from a
greater injury, are not surprised at any symptoms of nervous
agitation that may occur after punctured wounds. As many
bayonet wounds through muscular parts heal with little
trouble, it is time enough to dilate them when assistance
seems to be required. Cold water should be used at first;
care should be taken not to apply a roller or compress of
any kind over the wound; matter, when formed, should be
frequently pressed out, and, if necessary, a free exit should
be made for it.</p>

<p>23. A great delusion is cherished in Great Britain on the
subject of the bayonet&mdash;a sort of monomania very gratifying
to the national vanity, but not quite in accordance with
matter of fact. Opposing regiments, when formed in line,
and charging with fixed bayonets, never meet and struggle
hand to hand and foot to foot, and this for the very best
possible reason, that one side turns round and runs away as
soon as the other comes close enough to do mischief; doubtless
considering that discretion is the better part of valor.
Small parties of men may have personal conflicts after an
affair has been decided, or in the subsequent scuffle if they
cannot get out of the way fast enough. The battle of Maida
is usually referred to as a remarkable instance of a bayonet
fight; nevertheless, the sufferers, whether killed or wounded,
French or English, suffered from bullets, not bayonets. The
late Sir James Kempt commanded the brigade supposed to
have done this feat, but he has assured me that no charge
with the bayonet took place, the French being killed in line
by the fire of musketry; a fact which has of late received a
remarkable confirmation in the published correspondence of
King Joseph Bonaparte, in which General Regnier, writing
to him on the subject, says: “The 1st and 42d Regiments
charged with the bayonet until they came within fifteen
paces of the enemy, when they turned, <i>et prirent la fuite</i>.
The second line, composed of Polish troops, had already
done the same.” Wounds from bayonets were not less rare
in the Peninsular war. It may be that all those who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
bayoneted were killed, yet their bodies were seldom found.
A certain fighting regiment had the misfortune one very
misty morning to have a large number of men carried off
by a charge of Polish lancers, many being also killed. The
commanding officer concluded they must be all killed, for
his men possessed exactly the same spirit as a part of the
French Imperial guard at Waterloo. “They might be
killed, but they could not by any possibility be taken prisoners.”
He returned them all dead accordingly. A few
days afterward they reappeared, to the astonishment of
everybody, having been swept off by the cavalry, and had
made their escape in the retreat of the French army through
the woods. The regiment from that day obtained the ludicrous
name of the “Resurrection men.”</p>

<p>The siege of Sebastopol has furnished many opportunities
for partial hand to hand bayonet contests, in which
many have been killed and wounded on all sides, but I do
not learn that in any engagements which have taken place
regiments advanced against each other in line and really
crossed bayonets as a body; although the individual bravery
of smaller parties was frequently manifested there, as well as
in the war in the Peninsula.</p>

<p class="h2sub">ON INFLAMMATION, MORTIFICATION, ETC.</p>

<p>24. In some very rare cases, an intense, deep-seated inflammation
supervenes after some days, almost suddenly and
without any obvious cause. The skin is scarcely affected,
although the limb&mdash;and this complaint has hitherto been
observed only in the thigh&mdash;is swollen, and exceedingly
painful. If relief be not given, these persons die soon, and
the parts beneath the fascia lata appear after death softened,
stuffed, and gorged with blood, indicating the occurrence of
an intense degree of inflammation, only to be overcome by
general blood-letting; and especially by incisions made
through the fascia from the wound, deep into the parts, so
as to relieve them by a considerable loss of blood, and by
the removal of any pressure which the fascia might cause on
the swollen parts beneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
25. Erysipelatous inflammation is marked by a rose or
yellowish redness, tending in bad constitutions to brown or
even to purple, but in all cases terminating by a defined
edge on the white surrounding skin. It frequently spreads
with great rapidity, so that the limb, and even the whole
skin of the body, may be in time affected by it, the redness
subsiding and even disappearing in one part, while it extends
in another direction. When this inflammation attacks
young and otherwise healthful persons of apparently good
constitution, it should be treated by emetics, purgatives, and
diaphoretics, in the first instance, with, perhaps, in some
cases, bleeding. When the habit of body is not supposed
to be healthy, bleeding is inadmissible, and stimulating diaphoretics,
combined with camphor and ammonia, will be
found more beneficial after emetics and purgatives; these
remedies may in turn be followed by quinine and the mineral
acids, with the infusion and tincture of bark. Little reliance
can be placed on large doses of cinchona in powder; they
nauseate and therefore distress.</p>

<p>When the inflammation extends deeper than the skin, into
the areolar or cellular tissue, it partakes more of the nature
of the healthy suppurative inflammation, commonly called
phlegmonous, is accompanied by the formation of matter,
and tends to the sloughing or death of this tissue at an early
period. The redness in this case is of a brighter color,
although equally diffuse, and with a determined edge; the
limb is more swollen and tense, and soon becomes quagmiry
to the touch. The skin is then undermined, and soon loses
its life, becomes ash colored and gangrenous in spots, and
separates, giving exit to the slough and matter which now
pervade the whole extremity affected. If the patient survive,
it will probably be with the loss of the whole of the
skin and the cellular substance of the limb.</p>

<p>As soon as the inflamed part communicates the springy,
fluctuating sensation approaching, but not yet arrived at the
quagmiry feel alluded to, an incision should be made into it,
when the areolæ or cells of the cellular tissue will be seen of
a bright leaden color, and of a gelatinous appearance, arising
from the fluid secreted into them, being now nearly in
the act of being converted into pus. The septa, dividing
the tissue into cells, have not at this period lost their life,
and the fluid hardly exudes, as it will be found to do a few
hours later, when the matter deposited has become purulent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
When this change has taken place, the patient is in danger,
and if relief be not given, he will often sink under the most
marked symptoms of irritative fever of a typhoid type.
Nature herself sometimes gives the required relief by the
destruction of the superincumbent skin; but this part is
tough, offers considerable resistance, and does not readily
yield until the deep-seated fascia is implicated, and the
muscular parts are about to be laid bare.</p>

<p>An incision made into the inflamed part through the cellular
tissue, down to the deep-seated fascia, which should
not be divided in the first instance, gives relief. One of four
inches in length usually admits of a separation of its edges
to the amount of two inches, by which the tension of the
skin, which principally causes the mischief which follows the
inflammation, is removed. As many incisions are required
as will relieve this tension, according to the extent of the
inflammation, which is also relieved by the flow of blood, but
that requires attention, as it is often considerable, particularly
if the deep fascia be divided on which the larger vessels
are found to lie. If the necessary incisions be delayed
until the quagmiry feeling is fully established, the skin above
it is generally undermined and dies. The following case is
given as the first known in London, in which long incisions
were made for the cure of this disease, and their effect in
relieving the constitutional irritation is so strongly marked
as to need no further explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thomas Key, aged forty, a hard drinker, was admitted
into the Westminster Hospital, under my care, on the 21st
of October, 1823, having fallen and injured his left arm
against a stool, four days previously. On the 30th, the skin
being very tense, the part springy, and yielding the boggy
feel described, pulse 120, mind wandering, I proposed, in
consultation with my colleagues, to make incisions into the
part, but which were considered to be unusual and improper.
On the 31st, the pulse being 140, and everything
indicating a fatal termination, I refrained from any further
consultation, although directed by the rules of the hospital;
and, after my old Peninsular fashion, made an incision
eight inches long into the back of the arm, and
another of five on the under edge, in the line of the ulna,
down to the fascia, which was in part divided; one vessel
bled freely. The next day, November 1, the pulse was 90;
the man had slept, and said he had had a good night. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
incision on the back of the arm was augmented to eleven
inches; and from that time he gradually recovered, being
snatched as it were from the jaws of death.</p>

<p>This case, published at the time, has been the exemplar
on which this most successful practice has been followed
throughout the civilized world&mdash;a practice entirely due to
the war in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>When this kind of inflammation attacks the scrotum,
which it sometimes, although rarely, does, as a sporadic
disease, independent of any urinary affection, incisions into
it should be made with great caution, not extending beyond
the discolored spots, in consequence of the loss of blood
which would ensue from the great vascularity of the part.
They should be confined to, and not extend beyond, the
parts obviously falling into a state of slough or of mortification.</p>

<p>26. Mortification is the last and most fatal result of inflammation,
although it may occur as a precursor of it in the
neighboring parts, and not as a consequence. The essential
distinction is, between that which is <i>idiopathic</i> or <i>constitutional</i>
and that which is <i>local</i>; and has not existed long
enough to implicate the system at large, or to become
<i>constitutional</i>. Idiopathic or constitutional mortification,
sphacelus or gangrene, may be <i>humid</i> or <i>dry</i>. <i>Humid</i>,
when the death of the part has been preceded by inflammation
and a great deposition of fluid in it, followed by putrefaction
and decomposition, as after an attack of erysipelas
following an injury. It may then be said to be acute. Dry,
when preceded by little or no deposition of fluid in it, and
followed by a drying, shriveling, and hardening of the part,
nearly in its natural form and shape, unless exposed to
external causes usually leading to putrefaction. The most
remarkable instances have occurred in persons suffering from
typhus fever, and exposed to cold, without sufficient covering
or care. When it occurs in old persons, or in those who
have lived on diseased rye or other food, it may be called
chronic. The gangrene which follows wounds has been
termed <i>traumatic</i>, which explains nothing but the fact of
its following an injury.</p>

<p><i>Local</i> mortification may be the effect of great injury applied
direct to the part, or of an injury to the great vessels
of the limb. It may occur from intense cold freezing the
part, or from intense heat burning or destroying it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
27. It sometimes happens that a cannon-ball strikes a
limb, and without apparently doing much injury to the skin,
so completely destroys the internal textures that gangrene
takes place almost without an effort on the part of nature to
prevent it. This kind of injury was formerly attributed to
the wind of a ball; but no one who has seen noses, ears, etc.
injured or carried away, and all parts of the body grazed,
without such mischief following, can believe that either the
wind, or the electricity collected by it, can produce such
effect.</p>

<p>The patient is aware of having received a severe blow on
the part affected, which does not show much external sign
of injury, the skin being often apparently unhurt or only
grazed; the power of moving the part is lost, and it is insensible.
The bone or bones may or may not be broken, but in
either case the sufferer, if the injury be in the leg, is incapable
of putting it to the ground. After a short time the limb
changes color in the same manner as when severely bruised,
and the necessary changes rapidly go on to gangrene. The
limb swells, but not to any extent, and more from extravasation
between the muscles and the bones than from inflammation,
which, although it is attempted to be set up, never
attains to any height. The mortification which ensues tends
to a state between the humid and the dry, and rather more
to the latter than the former. These cases are not of frequent
occurrence, and are not commonly observed until after
the blackness of the skin, and the want of sensibility and
motion attract attention; for the patient is generally stupefied
at first by the blow, and the part or parts about the
injury feel benumbed. I made these cases an object of particular
research after the battle of Waterloo, but could find
only one among the British wounded. The man stated that
he had received a blow on the back part of the leg, he believed
from a cannon-shot, which brought him to the ground,
and stunned him considerably. On endeavoring to move,
he found himself incapable of stirring, and the sensibility
and power of motion in the limb were lost. The leg gradually
changed to a black color, in which state he was carried
to Brussels. When I saw it, the limb was black, apparently
mortified, and cold to the touch; the skin was not abraded;
the leg was not so much swollen as in cases of humid gangrene;
the mortification had extended nearly as high as the
knee; there was no appearance of a line of separation; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the signs of inflammation were so slight that amputation
was performed immediately above the knee. On dissecting
the limb, I found that a considerable extravasation of bloody
fluid had taken place below the calf of the leg, and in the
cavity thus formed some ineffectual attempts at suppuration
had commenced. The periosteum was separated from the
tibia and fibula; the popliteal artery was, on examination,
found closed in the lower part of the ham by coagulated
lymph, proceeding from a rupture of the internal coat of the
vessel. Two inches below this the posterior tibial and fibular
arteries were completely torn across, and gave rise, in
all probability, to the extravasation. The operation was
successful. The proper surgical practice in such cases is to
amputate as soon as the extent of the injury can be ascertained,
in order that a joint may not be lost, as the knee was
in this instance. It is hardly necessary to give a caution
not to mistake a simple bruise or ecchymosis for mortification.
To prevent such an error leading to amputation,
Baron Larrey has directed an incision to be previously made
into the part, and to this there can be no objection.</p>

<p>When a large shot or other solid substance has injured a
limb to such an extent only as admits of the hope of its
being possible to save it, this hope is sometimes found to
be futile, at the end of three or four days, from a failure of
power, in the part below the injury, to maintain its life for
a longer time: mortification is obviously impending. In
military warfare, uncontrollable events often render amputation
unavoidable in such a case. Under more favorable circumstances,
the surgeon should be guided by the principle
laid down of <i>constitutional</i> and <i>local</i> mortification; and,
although the line cannot perhaps be distinctly drawn between
them at the end of three, four, or more days, it will
be better to err on the side of amputation than of delay. If
the limb should be swollen or inflamed to any distance, with
some constitutional symptoms, in a doubtful habit of body,
the termination will in general be unfavorable, whichever
course be adopted, more particularly if the amputation must
be done above the knee. The consideration of the circumstances
in which the patient is placed, his age, and habit of
body, should have great weight in forming a decision in the
first instance, as to the propriety of attempting to save the
limb, which ought only to be done in persons of good constitution
and apparent strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
28. Whenever the main artery of a limb is injured by a
musket-ball, mortification of the extremity will frequently be
the result, particularly if it be the femoral artery; it will be
of certain occurrence if both artery and vein are injured,
although they may not be either torn or divided. There
may not then be such a sudden loss of blood, in considerable
quantity, as to lead to the suspicion of the vessel being
injured. The fact is known from the patient’s soon complaining
of coldness in the toes and foot, accompanied by
pain, felt especially in the back part or calf of the leg, or in
the heel, or across the instep, together with an alteration of
the appearance of the skin of the toes and instep, which,
when once seen, can never be mistaken. It assumes the
color of a <i>tallow candle</i>, and soon the appearance of <i>mottled
soap</i>. Although there may be little loss of temperature
under ordinary circumstances of comfort, there is a feeling
of numbness, but it is only at a later period that the foot
becomes insensible. This change marks the extent of present
mischief. The temperature of the limb above is somewhat
higher than natural, and some slight indications of
inflammatory action may be observed as high as the ham,
and the upper part of the tibia in front; it is at these parts
that the mortification usually stops when it is arrested. The
general state of the patient, during the first three or four
days, is but little affected, and there is not that appearance
of countenance which usually accompanies mortification from
constitutional causes. In a day or two more, the gangrene
will frequently extend, when the limb swells, becomes painful,
and more streaked or mottled in color; the swelling
passes the knee, the thigh becomes œdematous, the patient
more feverish and anxious, then delirious, and dies.</p>

<p>An extreme case will best exemplify the practice to be
pursued. A soldier is wounded by a musket-ball at the
upper part of the middle third of the thigh, and on the
third day the great toe has become of a tallowy color and
has lost its life. What is to be done? Wait with the hope
that the mortification will not extend. Suppose that the
approaching mortification has not been observed until it
has invaded the instep. What is to be done? Wait, provided
there are no constitutional symptoms; but if they
should present themselves, or the discoloration of the skin
should appear to spread, amputation should be performed
forthwith, for such cases rarely escape with life if it be not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
done. Where in such a case should the amputation be performed?
I formerly recommended that it should be done
at the part injured in the thigh. I do not now advise it to
be done there at an early period, when the foot only is implicated;
but immediately below the knee, at that part where,
if mortification ever stops and the patient survives, it is
usually arrested; for the knee is by this means saved, and
the great danger attendant on an amputation at the upper
third of the thigh is avoided. The upper part of the femoral
artery, if divided, rarely offers a secondary hemorrhage.
The lower part, thus deprived by the amputation of its reflex
blood, can scarcely do so; and if it should, the bleeding may
be suppressed by a compress. The blood will be dark
colored. If the upper end should bleed, the blood will
be arterial, and by jets, and the vessel must be secured by
ligature.</p>

<p>29. When from some cause or other amputation has not
been performed, and the mortification has stopped below the
knee, it is recommended to amputate above the knee after a
line of separation has formed between the dead and the
living parts. This should not be done. The amputation
should be performed in the dead parts, just below the line of
separation, in the most cautious and gentle manner possible,
the mortified parts which remain being allowed to separate
by the efforts of nature. A joint will be saved, and the
patient have a much better chance for life.</p>

<p>30. A wound of the axillary artery rarely leads to mortification
of the fingers or hand. If it should do so, the principle
of treatment should be similar, although the saving of
the elbow is not so important as that of the knee: neither
is the amputation in the axilla, below the tuberosities of the
humerus, as dangerous as that above the knee.</p>

<p>31. Mortification after the sudden application of intense
cold or heat is to be treated on similar principles.</p>

<p>32. When a nerve or plexus of nerves conveying sensation
and motion, and going to a part, or an extremity of the
body, is divided, the part or limb is deprived of three great
qualities: motion, sensation, and the power of resisting with
effect the application of a degree of heat or of cold, which
is innocuous when applied in a similar manner to the opposite
or sound extremity. In other words, it will be scalded
by hot water and frost-bitten by iced or even cold water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which are harmless when applied to another and a healthy
part.</p>

<p>An officer received, at the battle of Salamanca, two balls,
one under the left clavicle, which was supposed to have
divided the brachial plexus of nerves, as the arm dropped
motionless and without sensation to the side. The other
ball passed through the knee-joint, which suppurated. The
left side of the chest became affected; he suffered from
severe cough, followed by hectic fever, and was evidently
about to sink. As a last chance, I amputated his leg above
the knee, after which he slowly recovered. Fourteen years
afterward he showed me his arm in the same state, and
told me he had been indicted for a rape, but that the magistrates,
seeing the wooden leg and the useless arm, while
admitting the attempt, would not assent to the committal
of the offence.</p>

<p>33. When one nerve only of several going to an extremity
such as the arm and hand, is divided, the loss sustained is
confined to the extreme part more immediately supplied by
the injured nerve. Thus, if the ulnar nerve only be divided,
the little finger and the adjacent side of the ring finger
suffer, perhaps in some degree the inner side of the thumb
and the adjoining fingers; if the median nerve, the thumb
and other fingers; if the radial, the back of the hand next
the thumb. In some instances there seems to be a kind of
collateral communication by which a degree of sensibility is
after a time recovered.</p>

<p>34. If any foreign substance should lodge in and continue
to irritate the nerve, the wounded part often becomes
so extremely painful as not to be borne; the nerve at that
part forms a tumor of a most painful character, requiring
removal, or in extreme cases even the amputation of the
extremity.</p>

<p>35. After an ordinary amputation, the extremity of a
nerve enlarges so as to resemble a leek, and if this should
adhere to the cicatrix of the wound, painful symptoms, referred
to the toes and other parts of the removed leg, are
experienced often to an almost unbearable degree; the end
of the nerve should be removed. The pain apparently felt
in and referred to the toes is merely the effect of irritation of
the extremity of the nerve.</p>

<p>36. Wounds or injuries of nerves, which do not entirely
divide the trunk, or a principal branch given off from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
plexus of nerves, may give rise to general as well as to local
symptoms; that is, by sympathy, connection, or continuity
of disease, other nerves and organs of the body are affected.
This applies also to the spinal marrow, when the injury
does not destroy at once. General Sir James Kempt was
wounded at the storming of the castle of Badajoz, on the
inside of the left great toe, by a musket-ball which, from the
appearance of a slit-like opening, was supposed to have rebounded
from the bone, but was discovered a fortnight
afterward flattened and lying between it and the next toe.
Inflammation had ensued, followed by great irritability and
numerous spasmodic attacks, appearing to render locked-jaw
probable. The spasms soon became general, extending
from the foot to the head, but tetanus did not take place.
On his return to England, they gradually subsided, but he
did not sleep at night for a year. After the battle of Waterloo
the spasms became more frequent and troublesome, attacking
the muscles at the back of the neck and throat,
causing considerable anxiety. The attack was often traced
to exposing the foot to cold or to undue pressure, and
frequently to derangement of stomach, although he was
most regular in diet. After the lapse of six or seven years
these severe symptoms subsided; but during the last forty
years of his life he suffered occasionally from them.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir Philip Broke received a cut with a sword on
boarding the Chesapeake, on the left side of the back of the
head, which went through his skull, rendering the brain
visible; the wound healed in six months, although splinters
of bone came away for a year. A second cut on the right
side did not penetrate the bone. After a temporary paralysis
of the right side, he recovered, with a loss of power
and a disordered sensation in the second, third, and little
fingers of the right hand, aggravated by cold weather and
by mental anxiety.</p>

<p>Seven years afterward, he fell from his horse, and suffered
from concussion of the brain, which added to his former
sensations by rendering the left half of his whole person
incapable of resisting cold, or of evolving heat. In a still
atmosphere abroad, at 68° Fahr., he said, “the left side
requires four coatings of stout flannel, which are augmented
as the thermometer descends every two degrees and a half,
to prevent a painful sense of cold; so that when it stands at
the freezing point the quantity of clothing of the affected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
side becomes extremely burdensome. When exposed to a
breeze, or even in moving against the air, one or even two
oilskin coverings are necessary in addition, to prevent a
sensation of piercing cold driving through the whole frame.
Moderate horse exercise and generous diet improved the
general health; the warm bath caused a distressing effect;
the shower bath, cold or tepid, increased the paralytic affection.
Frictions, with remedies of all kinds, increased it
also, and so did sponging with vinegar and water, as well as
any violent, stimulating, quick excitement, or earnest attention
to any particular subject. The Admiral died unrelieved,
twenty-six years after the receipt of the injury, of
disease of the bladder.”</p>

<p>37. Brigade-Major Bissett was wounded on horseback,
in the Kaffir war, by a musket-ball, which entered on the
outside of the lower part of the left thigh, passed upward
across the perineum, wounding the rectum within the anus&mdash;from
which part he lost a quantity of blood&mdash;and came
out through the pelvis on the opposite side. The course
of this ball was accounted for by the fact that he saw the
Kaffir who shot him standing some yards below him when
he fired. The ball, in its passage upward and across the
thigh, injured the great sciatic nerve, and the consequence
is continued pain in the toes, instep, and foot, with contraction
of the muscles, and lameness, together with the
usual incapability of bearing heat or cold, particularly the
latter, against which he is peculiarly obliged to guard.
The skin shows no sign of discoloration or derangement.
Position gives the explanation why the ball took such a
peculiar course; the symptoms show the nature of the injury.
From other effects he has perfectly recovered, but his
leg is comparatively useless, while it is a constant source of
suffering.</p>

<p>38. The cases related in the Lectures on wounds of
arteries, of mortification taking place in the foot and leg,
after the division of the principal artery in the thigh, show
that the maintenance of the life of a part depends on the
blood. The cases now related show that neither an injury
nor the division of the principal nerve, nor, perhaps, of all
the nerves going to a part, will destroy that life. The
complete failure of the circulation, in a part such as the foot,
impairs, but does not totally destroy, the sensibility imparted
by the nerves, until after the loss of life has taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
place, or until decomposition is about to occur. An injury
then to the nerve causes great pain, not usually at the part
injured, but in the extreme parts supplied by it; some loss
of the power of motion; some deprivation of its ordinary
sensibility, as shown by a feeling of numbness, and an incapability,
to a certain extent, of resisting heat or cold.
When all the nerves have been divided, the power of moving
the limb is lost, as well as its sensibility in a general sense.
The temperature remains at a natural standard under ordinary
circumstances, but no extra evolution of heat can take
place by which cold is resisted, nor any absorption of it,
which perhaps renders the application of a high temperature,
particularly when combined with moisture, dangerous.
The circulation is capable of maintaining the ordinary heat
of a part, although it is deprived of the influence of the
special nerves of sensation and of motion; but a greater
evolution of heat appears to depend on something communicated
by the nerves in a state of integrity. In the
case of Sir P. Broke, this something appeared to be derived
from the brain, on which part the wound was inflicted,
and the transmission of which was interrupted by the injury.
The evolution of animal heat has of late been supposed to
be dependent on electricity, from the resemblance which
exists between it and the nervous power, although the attempts
to identify them have not been successful. That the
evolution of heat is the result of nervous power, appears to
be indisputable; in what that power consists, physiologists
have yet to ascertain.</p>

<p>39. The best means of mitigating the pain, independently
of the application of warmth&mdash;and cold rarely does
good, as the sufferer soon finds out&mdash;is by the application
of stimulants to the whole of the extremity affected, followed
by narcotics. The tinctures of iodine and lytta, the
oleum terebinthinæ, the oleum tiglii or cajeputi, the liquor
ammoniæ or veratria, may be used in the form of an embrocation,
of such strength as to cause some irritation on
the skin, short, however, of producing any serious eruption.
After the parts have been well rubbed, opium, belladonna,
or henbane may be applied in the form of ointment; or the
tincture of opium, henbane, or aconite may in turn be applied
on linen. Great advantage has been derived in many
neuralgic pains from the application of an ointment of <i>aconitine</i>,
carefully prepared, in the proportion of one grain to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
drachm of lard, at which strength it will sometimes irritate
almost to vesication, as well as allay pain.</p>

<p>When the pains return from exposure to cold, particularly
in the lower extremity, great advantage has been derived
from cupping on the loins, from purgatives, opiates, and the
warm bath. Benefit has been obtained occasionally from
quinine, and from belladonna, aconite, and stramonium, administered
internally in small doses frequently repeated, but
not suffered to accumulate without purgation; as the accumulated
effects are sometimes dangerous.</p>

<p class="h2sub">AMPUTATIONS, ETC.</p>

<p>40. When the wound of an extremity is of so serious a
nature as to preclude all hope of saving the limb by scientific
treatment, it should be amputated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>41. An amputation of the upper extremity may almost
always be done from the shoulder-joint downward, without
much risk to life. When necessary, the sooner it is done
the better.</p>

<p>42. An amputation of any part of the lower extremity
below the knee may be done forthwith, with nearly an equal
chance of freedom from any immediate danger, as of the
upper extremity at or near the shoulder-joint.</p>

<p>43. It is otherwise with amputations above the middle
of the thigh, and up to the hip-joint. They are always
attended with considerable danger.</p>

<p>44. There can be no doubt that if the knife of the surgeon
could in all cases follow the ball of the enemy or the wheel
of a railway carriage, and make a clean good stump, instead
of leaving a contused and ragged wound, it would be greatly
to the advantage of the sufferer; but as this cannot be, and
an approach to it even can rarely take place, the question
naturally recurs,&mdash;At what distance of time, after the receipt
of the injury or accident, can the operation be performed
most advantageously for the patient?</p>

<p>45. In order to answer this question distinctly, it should
be considered with reference to distinct places of injury:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. When injuries require amputation of the arm below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the shoulder-joint, or of the leg below the knee, these operations
may be done at any time from the moment of infliction
until after the expiration of twelve or twenty-four hours,
without any detriment being sustained by the sufferer with
regard to his recovery; although every one, under such circumstances,
must be desirous to have the operation over.
The surgeon having several equally serious cases of injury of
the head or trunk brought to him at the same time as two
requiring amputation of the upper extremity, may defer the
latter more safely perhaps than the assistance he is also
called upon to give to the other cases, the postponement of
which may be attended with greater danger.</p>

<p>2d. This state embraces those great injuries in which the
shoulder is carried away with some injury to the trunk; or
the thigh is torn off at or above its middle, rendering an
amputation of the upper third, or at the hip-joint, necessary.
It is this or nearly this state which alone implies a
doubt as to the propriety of immediate amputation, and demands
further investigation. It is the state to which attention
is earnestly drawn for future observation.</p>

<p>46. It has been implied, if not actually maintained, that
a man could have his thigh carried away by a cannon-shot
without being fully aware of it, or, if aware of it, that it did
not cause much alarm&mdash;in fact, that it did not materially
signify as to his apprehension, whether the ball took off his
limb or the tail of his coat, or only grazed his breeches. An
instance of this kind has not fallen under my observation.</p>

<p>47. A surgeon on the field of battle can rarely have a
patient brought to him, requiring amputation, under less
time than from a quarter to half an hour; a surgeon in a
ship may see his patient in less than five minutes after the
receipt of the injury; and to the surgeons of the navy we
must hereafter defer for their testimony as to the absence
or presence of the constitutional alarm and shock to which
I have alluded, and to what degree they follow, immediately
after the receipt of such injury. The question must not be
encumbered and mystified by a reference to all sorts of amputations
after all sorts of injuries, but to the one especial
injury, viz., that of the <i>upper third of the thigh</i>.</p>

<p>48. My experience, which may be erroneous, like everything
human, has taught me, that when a thigh is torn, or
nearly torn off, by a cannon-shot, there is always more or
less loss of blood, suddenly discharged, which soon ceases in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
death, or in a state approaching to syncope. When the
great artery has been torn, this fainting saves life, for an
artery of the magnitude of the common femoral does not
close its canal by retracting and contracting in the same
manner as a smaller vessel; it can only diminish it; and the
formation of an external coagulum is necessary to preserve
life, which the shock, alarm, and fainting, by taking off the
force of the circulation, aid in forming; and without which
the patient would bleed to death. An amputation, in this
state of extreme depression, might destroy life, although
aided by the exhibition of chloroform.</p>

<p>49. If the cannon-shot, or other instrument capable of
crushing the upper part of a thigh, should not divide the
principal artery, and the sufferer should not bleed, it is possible
he may be somewhat in the state alluded to in which
the patient, for he may not be called sufferer, is said to be
just as composed as if he had only lost a portion of his
breeches. Nevertheless few have seen a man lose even a
piece of his skin and of his breeches by a cannon-shot, without
perceiving that he was indisputably frightened. Dr.
Beith, surgeon of the <i>Belleisle</i>, hospital ship, in the Baltic,
informs me that Mr. Wrottesley, of the Engineers, was
struck by a cannon-shot, at Bomarsund, on the upper part
of his right thigh, which shattered it and his hand, which
was resting upon it. His leg was also broken by a splinter
from the gun which the ball had previously struck. The
femoral artery was not injured, and it was said he lost but
little blood. He, however, never rallied from the blow, but
sank in twenty minutes after he was brought to Dr. Beith.
The constitutional shock and alarm were great; countenance
sunk and pallid, pulse scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>“An East Indian, twenty-two years of age, of healthy
aspect, in the month of October, 1854, when proceeding on
a shooting excursion, at Moulmein, in Burmah, was most
severely wounded by the accidental explosion of his gun,
the entire charge of large shot lodging in the center of the
left thigh, and causing a bad compound fracture, with fearful
laceration of the soft parts. I was asked to see the patient
by Dr. Reynolds, the staff-surgeon of the station, at half-past
seven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, an hour after the injury had been inflicted, and
found him laboring under most urgent collapse and great
nervous depression. It was of course impossible to save the
limb, but I suggested delay for some hours, and the moderate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
use of stimulants, till the system had in some degree recovered
its equilibrium. Such was the case at five <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and
the flap operation was done while the man was under the
full influence of chloroform, (three drachms being required
for that purpose.) When placed in bed, he became conscious,
but never rallied, and died in half an hour.</p>

<p>“Very little blood was lost during the operation, and the
impression on my mind was, that it would have been wiser
to have steadily but carefully continued the use of stimulants
during the operation, and thus have counteracted the
shock of the latter following on that of the injury, from which
the system had only partially recovered.”&mdash;<i>Case by Dr.
Dane, Surgeon to the Forces.</i></p>

<p>Deputy Inspector-General Taylor informs me that “a
young muscular man, of the siege-train, had his left thigh
nearly carried off at its middle by a cannon-shot at Sebastopol.
The soft parts on the inside, including the artery,
escaped laceration; the remaining soft parts and large pieces
of bone were entirely carried away, the injury extending
above the middle of the bone. The muscles on the fore
part of the other thigh were extensively laid bare and injured.
The prostration was great; pulse feeble; the man’s
spirits were good, and he desired amputation under chloroform.
The left thigh was amputated at the upper third.
The chloroform, administered on a pocket-handkerchief,
lightly folded, and held over the nose and mouth, speedily
took effect. I am under the impression that the chloroform
not only caused insensibility to pain, but supported the system
during the operation, although the man died an hour
after its completion. Nevertheless, I think the chloroform
enabled the man to bear the operation better than he would
have done without it.”</p>

<p>This case does not quite meet my proposition as to the
effect of chloroform when the thigh has been carried off
nearer the hip-joint, with rupture of the principal artery;
cases which have hitherto been usually lost, whether amputation
is performed or not.</p>

<p>50. While some persons, under the loss of a thigh high
up, are reduced to a state of syncope, or nearly approaching
to it, which renders them almost or even entirely speechless,
others are said to suffer extreme pain, and earnestly
entreat assistance, under which circumstances amputation
should be performed forthwith. In the former, the
admin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>istration
of stimulants may render the operation less immediately
dangerous. In the latter, they will be beneficial, and
may save life.</p>

<p>51. Chloroform, or other similar medicaments, may produce
an effect in such cases as yet unknown. Its careful
administration may not destroy the ebbing powers of life,
and may render an amputation practicable, which could not
otherwise be performed without the greatest danger. It
may be otherwise; the point, however, is to be ascertained,
although in all cases of great suffering its use should be
unhesitatingly adopted.</p>

<p>Much difference of opinion having taken place on the
subject of chloroform, I requested Dr. Snow, who has superintended
its use in many of our hospitals, and in almost all
the cases of serious operation in private life, to draw up his
observations and opinions in the most compendious form
possible, which he has been so good as to do, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Chloroform may be given with safety and advantage to
every patient who requires, and is in a condition to undergo,
a surgical operation. A state of great depression, from
injury or disease, does not contra-indicate the use of chloroform.
This agent acts as a stimulant in the first instance,
increasing the strength of the pulse, and enabling the patient,
in a state of exhaustion, to go through an operation
much better than if he were conscious.</p>

<p>“Persons who have died from the effects of chloroform
had disease of the heart, or of some other vital organ, but
the majority had a sound state of constitution; and it seems
probable that the average health of persons who have been
the subject of accident has been at least as good as that of
those who have taken chloroform without ill effects. From
these and other considerations I am of opinion that accidents
from chloroform are to be prevented by care in its
administration, and not by the selection or rejection of cases
for its employment.</p>

<p>“When animals are made to breathe air containing not
more than four or five per cent. of the vapor of chloroform
till death ensues, the breathing ceases very gradually, being
first rendered laborious and then feeble, and the heart continues
to beat for a minute or two after respiration has
ceased. During this interval, while the heart is still beating,
the animal can be easily restored by artificial
respira<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>tion.
This mode of death from chloroform might undoubtedly
take place in the human subject, if a person were to
go on giving it regardless of the symptoms; but a careful
examination of all the recorded cases of death from this
agent shows that it has not occurred in this manner. On
the contrary, the symptoms of danger have in every instance
come on suddenly, and the action of the heart has been
arrested at the same moment as the breathing, or even
before it. This is precisely the way in which the lower
animals die when they are compelled to breathe air containing
eight or ten per cent. of the vapor of chloroform. It
is therefore evident that the cause of death is the inhalation
of the vapor of chloroform not sufficiently diluted with
common air.</p>

<p>“It requires more chloroform to suspend the functions of
the ganglionic nerves, which preside over the contractions
of the heart, than to suspend the functions of the medulla
oblongata and the nerves of respiration; but the action of
the heart may be arrested by the direct effect of this agent.
Chloroform, when inhaled, is absorbed by the blood in the
lungs, passes at once to the left cavities of the heart, and is
immediately sent through the coronary arteries to every part
of that organ, in less time, probably, than it can reach the
brain; or, supposing the respiration to be suddenly arrested
by the action of the chloroform on the brain, the vapor, not
being sufficiently diluted, is present in large quantities in
the lungs at the moment when the breathing ceases; and
becoming absorbed, in addition to that which was already
in the blood, has the effect of paralyzing the heart.</p>

<p>“Twenty-five minims of chloroform produce only twenty-six
cubic inches of vapor, and as one hundred cubic inches
of air, at 60° Fahr., will take up fourteen cubic inches of
vapor, and at 70° will take up twenty-four cubic inches, if
fully saturated, it is quite possible that the air during inhalation
may contain ten per cent. of the vapor, if means be
not taken to prevent it. Under these circumstances, each
hundred cubic inches of air would contain nearly ten minims
of chloroform, and this might be taken into the lungs at
once by a rather deep inspiration. The average quantity
of chloroform present in the blood of an adult, when sufficiently
insensible for a surgical operation, is eighteen minims,
while twenty-four minims are as much as can be present
in the system at one time with safety. The absorption of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
a little more than thirty minims would have the effect of
causing death, even if it were equally diffused throughout
the circulation. It must be evident, therefore, that to take
ten minims of chloroform into the lungs at one inspiration,
when insensibility is almost complete, must be attended with
danger.</p>

<p>“Robust persons, accustomed to hard work or violent
exercise, are very apt to become affected with rigidity of the
muscles and struggling, when nearly insensible from chloroform;
and they often hold the breath for a time, and then
draw a deep inspiration. It is under these circumstances
that several of the accidents from chloroform have taken
place, and extreme care is required to give the chloroform
more than usually diluted with air, when this state of unconscious
struggling and rigidity occurs.</p>

<p>“The most important point to attend to, in the exhibition
of chloroform, is to insure that the vapor shall be sufficiently
diluted with air during the whole process of inhalation.
This may be effected with a suitable apparatus and proper
attention, or if an inhaler be not at hand, the chloroform
should be diluted with one or two parts by measure of rectified
alcohol. One or two drachms of this may be placed on
a hollow sponge, and repeated when required. The spirit
has the effect of limiting the quantity of chloroform which
rises in vapor, while very little of the diluent is inhaled,
since, from its lower volatility, the greater part of it remains
on the sponge or handkerchief employed to exhibit the chloroform.</p>

<p>“When the chloroform vapor is so diluted that it does
not constitute more than four or five per cent. of the respired
air, its effects become developed very gradually and regularly.
The suspension of the sensibility of the conjunctiva
at the border of the eyelids is the best sign that the patient
will bear the operation without flinching, and the inhalation
should immediately be left off if the breathing become stertorous.
The pulse is not a very important guide in the exhibition
of chloroform, for the two following reasons: 1st, if
the vapor be sufficiently diluted with air, the pulse cannot
be seriously affected by it; and 2d, if it be not so diluted,
the pulse may cease suddenly, without previous warning of
danger.</p>

<p>“If the vapor of chloroform be sufficiently diluted with
air, it is practically impossible that any accident, really due
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
to this agent, should occur. In case of accident, however,
artificial respiration, very promptly and efficiently performed,
is the only means which affords a prospect of restoring the
patient&mdash;at all events, this is the only means found to restore
animals when it was obvious they would not recover spontaneously.
The prospect of success from artificial respiration
will depend on the greater or less extent to which the
heart is affected by the direct action of the chloroform.”</p>

<p>Mr. Syme, in his “Clinical Observations,” delivered in
the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh, recommends, in cases
of approaching death from the use of chloroform, that the
tongue should be drawn forward by means of a pair of artery
forceps, by which it is presumed the epiglottis is raised, and
a greater facility afforded for the admission of atmospheric
air, the inconvenience resulting from two small holes in the
tip of the tongue being amply compensated by the preservation
of life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am of opinion that attention should be
paid to the pulse, and whenever it begins to fail or flutter,
the inhalation of chloroform should be arrested; for respiration
and the pulse often cease almost simultaneously, and
in some instances have done so irrecoverably.</p>

<p>I formerly said that chloroform might be used with advantage
in all cases of injury requiring amputation, save
one, and in that one experience was wanting to decide the
point. It is when a thigh has been carried off by a cannon-ball,
or destroyed at its upper part by any other means,
such as the wheels of a railway carriage or other weighty
machine. When the thigh is carried off by a cannon-shot,
the artery being torn across, there is so great a shock and
so great a loss of blood at the moment, followed by fainting,
or such faintness as leads to the belief that the sufferer is
dying, and some do actually die without an effort at recovery.
In such a case, or in one somewhat similar, Dr. Snow and
others think chloroform would act as a stimulus, and that it
would enable the patient to bear the operation of amputation
with success, which he otherwise might not have done.
It may be so; but, as I believe nothing in surgery until
fairly tried and found to answer, I refrain, for the present,
from expressing a positive opinion, save that the trials
should be made with great caution, inasmuch as the observations
which have been made in the Crimea have not been
sufficiently numerous or so decisive as to settle the point in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
favor of the chloroform, although they confirm all the others
to which allusion has been made. In these cases a tourniquet
cannot be applied, and the sudden loss of blood saves
the life of the sufferer for the time, by suppressing the bleeding;
which suppression, I have long since pointed out, is
effected in the artery at the groin, by the formation of a
coagulum, and not by the contraction and retraction of the
vessel into the shape of the neck of a claret bottle, which
would take place at the lower third of the same artery in
the thigh under a similar injury; in which case, also, the
bleeding would cease by the unassisted efforts of nature. If
the artery, there or elsewhere, should, on the contrary, be
only partially divided, the person would bleed to death,
unless surgery of some kind should come to his aid.</p>

<p>52. When the sufferer is brought to the surgeon at the
end of half an hour, having lost a limb below the thigh or
shoulder by a cannon-shot, he will often be found in a state
of such great depression as to be likely to be destroyed by
the infliction of a serious and painful operation like amputation,
unless chloroform should relieve it. This has occurred
to me so often as to induce me formerly to recommend
delay for four, six, or even eight hours, if the unfortunate
person did not suffer much, and appeared likely to be
revived by the proper use of stimulants. If he should be in
great pain, the limb should be removed under chloroform.</p>

<p>53. This recommendation originated from the fact that,
as one seriously wounded man has as much claim as another
to the attention of the surgeon, all could not be attended to
at the same time; and the success following the deferred
cases of amputation was as great, if not greater, than in
those on which the operation was more immediately performed.</p>

<p>54. The advantageous results of <i>primary</i> amputations,
or those done within the first twenty-four, or at most forty-eight
hours, over <i>secondary</i> amputations, or those done at
the end of several days, or of three or four weeks, have
been so firmly and fully established as no longer to admit
of dispute.</p>

<p>55. When an amputation is deferred to the secondary
period, a joint is often lost. A leg which might have been
cut off below the knee in the first instance is frequently
obliged to be removed above the knee when done in the
second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
56. In the secondary period after great injuries, the areolar
and muscular textures near the part injured are often
unhealthy, the bones are in many instances inflamed internally,
and their periosteal membranes deposit on the surrounding
parts so much new ossific matter as frequently
to envelop in a few days the ligatures on the vessels, and
render them immovable, necrosis of the extremity of the
bone following as a necessary consequence, thus protracting
the cure for months.</p>

<p>57. Sloughing of the stump, accompanied by inflammation
of the vein or veins leading to the cava, frequently
takes place. This state of stump is often followed by purulent
deposits in and upon the different viscera, and principally
in the cavities of the chest. Where febrile diseases
are endemic, they often prevail; the constitutional irritation
is great; the stumps do not unite, or, if apparently united,
open out and slough, and frequently after a few days implicate
the veins.</p>

<p>58. In the first edition of my work on Gunshot Wounds,
and on the great operations of Amputation, published in
1815, I said, alluding to secondary operations: “In the
most favorable state of the stump, the diseased parts do not
extend very deep; yet inflammation is frequently communicated
along the vein, which is found to contain pus, even
as far as the vena cava.” “When I have met with this
appearance, I have always considered the vessels as participating
in (not originating) the disease, which had existed
some days, and thereby more quickly destroying the patient.”
I further said that after secondary amputations, the febrile
irritation, allayed by the operation, sometimes returns, and
more or less rapidly cuts off the patient by an affection of
some particular internal part or viscus, especially of the
lungs. “If it be the lungs, and they are most usually
affected, the breathing becomes uneasy; there is little pain
when the disease is compared with pneumonia or pleuritis;
the cough is dry and not very troublesome; the pulse having
been frequent, there is but little alteration; the attention of
the surgeon is not sufficiently drawn by the symptoms to the
state of the organ, and in a very short time all the symptoms
are deteriorated: blisters are employed, perhaps blood-letting,
but generally in vain; and the patient dies in a few
hours, as in the last stage of inflammation of the lungs, in
which effusion or suppuration has taken place.” “My
atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>tion
was drawn to it after losing several cases in this way,
as a circumstance of more than common accident, from its
having happened to a young officer to whom I was paying
considerable attention, (at Salamanca.) Since that I had
one well-marked case at Santander, of a sudden and fatal
affection of the lungs after amputation of the thigh, which
was under the immediate care of Dr. Irwin,” and of myself
as the principal medical officer. The late Mr. Rose, of the
Guards, communicated a case, after amputation of the arm,
to Sir James M’Grigor, who forwarded it to me; and my
old friend, the late Mr. Boutflower, who served frequently
under me during the latter part of that war, and aided me
in all my labors and views, forwarded to me, at the same
time, two cases from Fuenterabia, which terminated fatally
after amputation of the arm, from the deposition of a considerable
quantity of pus in the cavity of the thorax. “So
insidious,” he said, “was the approach of the disease, that,
except a difficulty of breathing which supervened a few hours
before death, there were no symptoms indicating the existence
of such a morbid affection.” No further notice was
taken of this disease by any one in any of the hospitals on
entering France in 1813, neither at St. Jean de Luz, nor
Bayonne, nor Pau, St. Sever, Tarbès, or Orthez, until after
the battle of Toulouse, where the following cases occurred,
which I published previously to any one else in 1815.</p>

<p>A soldier suffered amputation of the thigh five weeks after
the injury, in consequence of a gunshot fracture at Toulouse,
he being in a very reduced state, the discharge profuse, the
pain great, hectic fever severe. The third day after the
operation, from which he scarcely rallied, he complained of
difficulty in swallowing, and pain in the situation of the thyroid
gland, which was found next morning to be inflamed.
In spite of the means employed, he died on the fourth day
of this attack, or the seventh after the amputation, in a
state of great emaciation. On dissection, the whole substance
of the thyroid gland was destroyed, a deposit of good
pus occupying its place, which descended by the sides of the
trachea and œsophagus to the sternum, and had all but
found its way into the larynx, between the cricoid and
thyroid cartilages on the right side.</p>

<p>Daniel Lynch, wounded through the knee-joint at the
battle of Toulouse, on the 12th of April, 1814, had his thigh
amputated by the late Mr. Boutflower, on the 8th of May.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
The night succeeding the operation he passed comfortably.
Next day, the 9th, the febrile symptoms were augmented.
On the 10th he was worse; pulse 150. On the 11th he was
better. On the 16th he was considered to be in a state of
convalescence, and went on improving until the 22d, when
fever recurred. On the 28th his stomach became very irritable;
the stump appeared to be nearly healed, the discharge
being small, and of good quality; one ligature remained.
30th: Pulse 110; tongue of a brownish hue. During the
31st and 1st of June he got worse, and died. The stump
appeared to have united externally, except where the ligatures
came out; but, on cutting through the line of adhesion,
the muscular parts within were evidently unhealthy;
the bone was surrounded for some distance by a case of
osseous matter, including the remaining ligature, which
could not be removed by any force short of breaking it.
The femur was bare, and showed marked signs of absorption
having commenced; three inches of it must have come
away if the man had lived. The extremity of the vein was
in a sloughing state.</p>

<p>Having dissected the other extremity for a clinical lecture
I was occasionally in the habit of giving on particular cases,
a semi-transparent membranous bag, containing good pus,
was found accidentally on the tibialis posticus muscle. The
blood in the perineal vein outside of it was coagulated;
there were little or no marks of inflammation, and the matter
appeared to have been deposited without any. The
inner side of the soleus muscle seemed simply to be discolored.</p>

<p>The first edition, containing these facts, which were before
unknown, and which furnish another laurel to the surgery of
the Peninsular war, having been published before the battle
of Waterloo, the opinions and facts stated therein became
matters for public discussion, and the reports made by my
friends from Brussels, Antwerp, Yarmouth, and Colchester,
confirmed all the facts, and, I may add, all the opinions of
the slightest importance. They were published in the second
edition in 1820, and again more pointedly in the third, published
June 18, 1827.</p>

<p>59. Forty years have passed away since I stated my opinion,
that inflammation of the veins is of two kinds&mdash;the adhesive
or healthy, from which the sufferers usually recover,
as in the cases of women laboring under the disease called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
phlegmasia dolens, and the irritating or unhealthy, occurring
after operations; the disease being communicated by
continuity to the vein, rather perhaps than originating in it.
I then said I did not believe that pus is carried from the
inside of the vein to the general circulation, the office of the
vein as a carrier of blood ceasing on the inflammation taking
place in its internal tissue, although I admit that the blood
in a vitiated state, from the commencing disease in the
stump, or in the system, may have for some time passed
along it into the general circulation. The inflammation
thus commencing may extend upward and downward, and
across to the opposite side of the body, as I first demonstrated
in 1825, in the case of Jane Strangemore, p. 47. I
never saw it actually in the heart, the sufferers dying by the
time it had reached as high as the diaphragm, and in general
before it had got so far.</p>

<p>60. When a person, after undergoing amputation, is about
to suffer from unhealthy inflammation of the veins, the pulse
quickens, and continues above 90, usually rising from 100
to 130. The stomach becomes irritable; there are frequent
attacks of vomiting, generally of a bilious character, accompanied
by the usual symptoms of fever. A few days after
the commencement of the complaint, there is usually a well-marked
rigor, followed perhaps by others, but exacerbations
and remissions of fever are common. The skin gradually
assumes a yellowish tinge, the perspiration is excessive, the
bowels irregular, the pulse becomes weaker and more irritable,
the emaciation is considerable, and the patient gradually
sinks; or the febrile symptoms may subside, with the exception
of the frequency of the pulse, the patient rallies a little,
but while he says he is better, and the appetite even returns,
the deterioration in appearance becomes more marked, more
deathlike, even while eating, and an accession of fever
rapidly closes the scene. The stump is often not more
painful than under ordinary circumstances, neither is there
any remarkable pain or tenderness in the course of the
vessels.</p>

<p>61. The practical points are, to draw blood with caution,
on the <i>accession</i> of fever, provided a remittent or typhoid
form does not prevail; to open out the stump as soon as
possible, even by a division of the external adhesions, the
inner parts being usually unsound; to envelop it in a large
warm poultice; to apply cold above, even ice if procurable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the course of the great vessels, and to soothe the system
by calomel, opium, and saline diaphoretic remedies, followed
by stimulants, cordials, quinine, and acids.</p>

<p>Private A. Clarke, 79th Regiment, had his thigh broken
by a musket-ball a little above the knee-joint, at Waterloo,
and was admitted into the clinical ward of the York Hospital,
in London, in November, 1816. The bone being in
a state of necrosis, Mr. Guthrie amputated the thigh high
up, on the 20th of January, 1817. Pulse before and after
the operation 104. On the 25th, pulse 120; skin cool;
tongue moist; appeared weak and irritable. During the
26th and 27th, symptoms of low fever came on. 28th, suffered
severely from vomiting, general fever, greater prostration
of strength; stump had not united, but discharged good
pus. 30th, skin assumed a yellow tinge.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, had a rigor resembling a fit of
ague, and Mr. Guthrie declared his suspicion of the formation
of matter, probably in the liver, and of inflammation of
the veins of the stump. The symptoms gradually assumed
the character of typhus gravior, and on the 8th he died.
On dissection the liver was found enlarged, and weighing
six pounds; the other viscera were sound. On examining
the stump an abscess containing four ounces of good pus
was found in the under part, near the bone. The femoral
vein and those going to that part of the stump were inflamed,
and contained coagulated blood, lymph, and purulent
matter, the disease extending from the femoral to the
vena cava. The rigors on the 1st February marked the
formation of matter, the typhoid symptoms its continuance,
and the inflammation of the veins. Union was discouraged
from the first dressing.</p>

<p>The following case is so highly instructive on all points,
that it is transcribed from the <i>London Medical and Physical
Journal</i> for 1826:&mdash;</p>

<p>Jane Strangemore, aged twenty-eight, was admitted into
the Westminster Hospital, September 24, 1823, with an
elastic swelling of the whole of the knee-joint, measuring
twenty-seven inches and a half in circumference. The thigh
was amputated by Mr. Guthrie on Saturday, the 27th, the
bone being sawn through just below the trochanter. She
suffered a good deal from pain after the operation. An
opiate was administered and repeated, and she passed a
good night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
28th.&mdash;The pulse, which previous to the operation was
80, has increased to 100; there is, however, little heat of
skin, and she appears easy. Some aperient medicine, and
saline draughts to be given every four hours. Toward the
evening, she vomited a quantity of bilious matter; pulse 120.
Three grains of calomel and one of opium, followed by the
common aperient mixture, were ordered, and an enema.
Equal parts of ether and laudanum to be applied to the
region of the stomach, to which part pain was referred.</p>

<p>October 1st.&mdash;Better in all respects, but looking irritable
and ill; no pain anywhere; no sickness; appetite good;
pulse still quick.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;Two ligatures have come away; the wound looks
well; the edges have nearly healed; eats meat, and with a
good appetite.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;Not so well; pulse 120; skin hot; feels ill; complains
of pain in the other leg and thigh, which disturbed
her rest. Was well purged, and the leg fomented; the pain
was principally felt in the calf and in the heel.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Pulse 130; tongue furred; vomiting again of bile;
the pain in the thigh, extending upward to the groin and
downward to the heel, is intolerable, particularly in the
latter part; the thigh and leg much swelled, and tender to
the touch, although without redness; the swelling elastic,
yet yielding to the pressure of the finger, but not in any
manner like an œdematous limb. Mr. Guthrie pronounced
the disease this morning to be inflammation of the veins,
extending from the opposite side; but after a careful examination,
and on pressure, no pain was felt in the course of
the iliac vessels of that side, and the stump looked well, save
at one small point corresponding to the termination of the
femoral vein.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;The symptoms continued nearly the same during
the week, the sickness of stomach and purging of bilious
matter abating at intervals.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Less pain in the limb, which is swollen and tender
to the touch, the superficial veins being all very much enlarged.
The groin more swollen and tender; sickness gone,
and her appetite returning; she is allowed good nourishing
simple diet. The stump has been poulticed since the 9th, to
promote suppuration.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;During these five days it was interesting to see
the patient eat, and desire solid food, and, in her extremely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
emaciated state, seem to enjoy it. The bowels occasionally
deranged. Pulse always from 125 to 136. Is slightly
jaundiced in color, but declares that she is better, and will
get well.</p>

<p>27th.&mdash;Gradually sank in the evening, and died; the limb
having everywhere diminished in size, except at the groin,
where the swelling was more circumscribed, resembling the
appearance of a chronic abscess approaching the surface.
On examination after death, the termination of the vein on
the face of the stump was open, and in a sloughy state;
above that, for the distance of four inches, and as high as
Poupart’s ligament, the inside of the vein bore marks of
having been inflamed, but the inflammation seemed to have
been of an adhesive character; above that point, the inflammation
appeared to have been of an irritative or erysipelatous
kind, had gone on to suppuration, and the vein was
filled with purulent matter, lymph, and blood, partly coagulated
and partly broken down. These appearances extended
up the cava as high as the diaphragm, and traces of
inflammation could be distinctly observed almost in the auricle.
The disease had passed along the right external iliac
and its branches; it had descended along the left iliac vein
and its branches in the pelvis to the uterus, and along the
limb to the sole of the foot. At the left groin the iliac vein,
becoming femoral, was greatly distended with pus, apparently
of good quality, and, if the patient had lived a day
or two longer, it would have been discharged by a natural
effort, as in chronic abscess; the viscera were healthy.</p>

<p>During the last days of this woman’s life, no blood was
returned from the lower half of the body, unless by the superficial
veins; yet she was comparatively easy, although of
a yellow hue, emaciated to the utmost, so as to represent a
living skeleton; in this state, with a pulse at 130, craving
for and eating a whole mutton-chop and more at a time,
with the most deathlike countenance it is possible to conceive.</p>

<p>These two cases mark the course, the symptoms, and the
termination of inflammation of the veins after amputation,
in as clear (if not a more clear) and distinct manner as
any which have since been published, and which they preceded;
nevertheless, most authors of more modern date
overlook the first, and some appear to avoid as much as
possible noticing the second.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
62. After the battle of Waterloo, the wounded of the
same regiment were sent indiscriminately, some to Brussels,
others to Antwerp. Those who remained at Brussels suffered
principally from inflammatory fever after amputation;
those at Antwerp, from the epidemic fever prevailing at the
time, beginning us an intermittent and ending often in typhus;
facts of great importance to recollect, as showing the
influence of malaria. The following are instances of endemic
fever after secondary amputation, ending in subacute
inflammation of the lungs and effusion into the chest:&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles Brown, 92d Regiment, forty years of age, at that
time a healthy man, was wounded on the 18th June by two
musket-balls in the right hand and wrist; he was admitted
into the hospital at Antwerp on the 25th June. On the
5th July, the arm was swollen above the elbow; discharge
profuse and fetid; countenance sallow and dejected; fever.
8th: Arm amputated above the elbow. 9th, 10th, 11th: A
little increase of fever. 12th: A paroxysm of intermittent,
to which he had been subject occasionally since he had been
at Walcheren. On removing the dressing, the edges of the
stump were retorted; discharge copious and fetid; respiration
hurried; thirst; skin hot and yellowish; pulse 90.
14th: Intermittent returned; head affected in consequence
of long continuance in the hot bath. 15th: Complains
to-day of fullness and pain in the left side; pulse 100; skin
of a deeper tinge of yellow; a sense of suffocation when
in the horizontal position. A blister was applied to the
whole of the side of the chest. 16th: Was delirious during
the night; vomited frequently; became insensible at the
hour when the paroxysm of intermittent fever was expected
to return; and died in the evening. On opening the chest,
the lungs were found adhering to the pleuræ costales in
several places, and were hepatized; a quantity of serum
and lymph was contained in the left pleura, so as to compress
the lung, in which there was a small abscess. The
liver was twice the natural size.</p>

<p>J. Lomax, of the Guards, was wounded at Waterloo, suffered
amputation of the right arm on the 23d August, and
arrived at the General Hospital, Colchester, on the 27th, in
a state of high fever, and unable to give any distinct account
of himself. He had had the ague, he said, for many
days, which left him for a short time, but returned when on
board ship; on the 25th he was attacked by pain in the side,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which was very severe on the 26th, on which day a blister
was applied, which greatly relieved him. The stump had
an unhealthy appearance, the edges of the wound evincing
a disposition to separate. On the 28th he was free from
pain; fever unabated, with a tendency to delirium. He
sank rapidly on the 30th, and died on the 31st, notwithstanding
the use of the most powerful stimuli. A quantity
of serum was found on dissection in the left side of the chest,
and the pleura pulmonalis on each side was covered with a
thick layer of coagulable lymph. The pericardium was distended
with fluid. The liver was enormously enlarged,
pushing up the diaphragm, and displacing the lung, having
in its substance a large abscess containing at least a quart
of pus. The stump did not exhibit any peculiar appearance.</p>

<p>O. Sweeney, 90th Regiment, aged nineteen, was wounded
in the hand on the 18th of June, 1815, and taken to Brussels.
On the 5th of July he left for England, and arrived
at Colchester on the 14th. The wound shortly after assumed
an unhealthy appearance; hemorrhage took place,
and the arm was amputated on the 30th. The day after,
he had severe rigors for fifteen minutes, followed by fever.
The next day he was better, and appeared to be doing well
until the 6th of August, when fever recurred. Stump quite
healthy in appearance. On the 7th, he was attacked by
vomiting and purging, which lasted several hours, and reduced
him much, returning at intervals until the evening of
the 8th. Small quantities of wine and opium agreed best,
and a blister was applied to the scrobiculus cordis. On the
9th, he complained of pain and tenderness in the abdomen,
which were relieved by fomentations and an enema. The
stump looked well, and discharged healthy pus in small
quantity; the ligature on the brachial artery came away.
On the 10th, his strength failed, and the tongue and teeth
were covered with a dark sordes. The adhesions of the
stump appeared disposed to separate. At night he was
restless, with low delirium; and on the 11th died, with the
complete facies Hippocratica. On raising the sternum, the
pleura of the left lung was found adhering to that of the
ribs, and covered by a thick layer of coagulable lymph. The
lung was highly inflamed; and on cutting into its substance,
a number of small tubercles was observed. The pericardium
and left cavity of the thorax contained more than the usual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
quantity of fluid. During the progress of this case, eleven
days from the amputation no one symptom existed which
could induce a suspicion of inflammation going on in the
thorax. The stump was in a sloughing state, but the disease
did not extend along the brachial veins.</p>

<p>Thomas Haynes, 23d Light Dragoons, aged nineteen, was
wounded by a spear on the back of the left forearm, at Waterloo;
the wound appeared to do well until he left Brussels
for England, when it assumed an unfavorable appearance,
and on his arrival at Colchester, on the 14th of July, it was
in a sloughing state. The pain was excessive, and the tenderness
around the whole circumference of the sore was so
great that he could not suffer the slightest pressure with
the finger. He was largely bled, and a solution of sulphuric
acid, one drachm to twelve ounces of water, was applied
twice a day to the whole surface, and the whole kept wet
with cold water; this treatment was continued until the
21st, during which period he was bled five times, to about
twenty ounces each time. The acid solution was increased
in strength from one drachm to an ounce, and care was taken
that the sloughing portions only were touched with it. His
health was considerably amended, and on the whole a favorable
result was expected. At two on the 22d, however, a
sudden hemorrhage took place, to the amount of three pints;
a second ensuing on the 23d, the arm was amputated. The
pulse continued quick; in other respects he was doing well,
until the 25th, when some accession of fever took place, and
increased. He was bled to ten ounces, and purged. On
the 26th, the line of incision in the stump appeared to be
healed; and with the exception of the pulse at 140, he had
no unpleasant symptom on the 27th, and was free from pain
of every kind. On removing the center strap, which had
been allowed to remain, a large collection of matter of good
quality issued. On the 28th, he was much the same. On
the 29th, the countenance had assumed a deathlike paleness;
pulse 120, intermitting every fifth pulsation; breathing
short and laborious, with some pain in the chest, and
every symptom of effusion having taken place. He died at
two <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, six days after the amputation.</p>

<p>The only morbid appearance found on dissection was a
large quantity of serous fluid in the pericardium, which was
distended by it, and on both sides of the chest. The heart
and lungs, with their membranes, were quite sound. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
examining the stump, the sanative process was found to
have been entirely confined to the integuments. No appearance
of granulation could be perceived on the muscular
surface.</p>

<p>This last case is worthy of especial observation, on account
of the manner in which sulphuric acid was used for
the sloughing state, from one drachm to one ounce of the
acid to twelve ounces of water, not as something new, but
as an ordinary application; and I am doubtful whether
there is any case on record of such use, anterior to it. Is
the external use of strong acids in sloughing cases also due
to the war in the Peninsula? Delpech says Yes,&mdash;a testimony
I shall confirm in its proper place.</p>

<p>I have departed, in some degree, in the foregoing observations,
from the aphorismal form I had prescribed for myself
in the commencement of these Commentaries. I have
done so as an act of justice to those officers who served at
Toulouse, Brussels, Antwerp, and Colchester, in 1814 and
1815, who are all now no more, and who labored hard in
the then early investigation of these different states of disease,
and have not received the reward they merited of
public acknowledgment. I have endeavored, as the late
Chancellor of the Exchequer says in his life of Lord George
Bentinck, to preserve for them the chastity of their honor.</p>

<p>63. Mr. Hunter, in 1793, described the appearances and
the fatal results of inflammation of the veins, as a consequence
of injuries inflicted on the surrounding parts, but I
apprehend I was the first person to point out the prevalence
of this complaint after secondary amputation, and its intimate
connection with certain low inflammatory attacks, attended
by destructive purulent depositions, particularly in
the chest, and their more chronic deposit in other parts.
Mr. Rose, of the Guards, published some observations in
the fourteenth volume of the <i>Medical and Chirurgical
Transactions</i>, in 1828, confirming the remarks made by me
in print thirteen years before, but without referring to them.
Mr. Arnott has an able paper on that subject in the fifteenth
volume. M. Sedillot thinks he has detected globules of pus
in different parts of the circulating system in persons who
had died of this disease. Mr. Henry Lee, 1850, one of the
last English writers on the subject, professedly doubts the
accuracy of the observation; this point remains among
others for further investigation. He admits, however, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
in cases where, from long-continued disease, there have been
repeated introductions of vitiated fluids into the circulation,
the blood loses much of its coagulating power, which prevents
the admission of purulent matter by the veins, by
forming coagula with it in them, thus constituting he thinks
the essential disease. When the coagulating power of the
blood is thus lost, he thinks it possible that pus-globules
may then be found circulating in it. Other late writers, and
lastly Dr. Hughes Bennett, think these diseases are dependent
on the introduction of a peculiar animal poison. Attention
should be paid by the medical officers of the public
service, whenever there is a war, to the state of the blood,
and to the inner lining of the diseased veins under the microscope;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and all those gentlemen, when in London, should
study its use, under Mr. Quekett, at the College of Surgeons,
to whose lectures they have the right of admission, and to
whose kindness they will all soon feel greatly indebted. I
am not aware that the writers referred to have added anything
to the practical facts I had related so long before,
which is much to be regretted. It is of little use, although
it is a step in the right direction, to describe a disease, or
even to show why and wherefore it destroys, unless a means
of prevention or of cure can also be indicated.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a>
The India Company have supplied the principal hospital of each
presidency with one good microscope at least; one of these, with a
person who understands its use, should be attached (but is not) to
the principal hospitals during the present war in the East.</p>

</div>

<p>64. In the irritable and sloughing state of stump alluded
to, hemorrhages frequently take place from the small
branches, or from the main trunks of the arteries, in consequence
of ulceration; and it is not always easy to discover
the bleeding vessel, or, when discovered, to secure it on the
face of the stump; for as the ulcerative process has not
ceased, and the end of the artery which is to be secured is
not sound, no healthy action can take place; the ligature
very soon cuts its way through, and the hemorrhage returns
as violently as before, or some other branch gives way; and
under this succession of ligatures and hemorrhages the patient
dies.</p>

<p>Some surgeons have, in such cases, preferred cutting down
upon the principal artery of the limb, in preference to performing
another amputation, even when it is practicable;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and they have sometimes succeeded in restraining the hemorrhage
for a sufficient length of time to allow the stump to
resume a more healthy action. This operation, although
successful in some cases, will generally fail, and particularly
if absolute rest cannot be obtained, when amputation will
become necessary. The same objection of want of success
may be made to amputation; on a due comparison of the
whole of the attending circumstances, the operation of tying
the artery in most cases is to be preferred in the first instance,
and if that prove unsuccessful, then recourse is to be
had to amputation; but this practice is by no means to be
followed indiscriminately. The artery ought to be secured
with reference to the mode of operating, as in aneurism, but
the doctrines of this disease are not to be applied to it, because
it is still a wounded vessel with an external opening.</p>

<p>To obviate all doubts, the part from which the bleeding
comes should be well studied, and the shortest distance from
the stump at which compression on the artery commands
the bleeding carefully noted; at this spot the ligature should
be applied, provided it be not within the sphere of the inflammation
of the stump. In case the hemorrhage should
only be restrained by pressure above the origin of the profunda,
and repeated attempts to secure the vessel on the
surface of the stump have failed, amputation is preferable to
tying the artery in the groin, when the strength of the patient
will bear it.</p>

<p>When hemorrhage takes place after amputation at or
below the shoulder-joint, it is a dangerous occurrence. An
incision should then be made through the integuments and
<i>across</i> the great pectoral muscle, when the artery may be
readily exposed, and a ligature placed upon it without difficulty
anywhere below the clavicle.</p>

<p>If the state of the stump in any of these cases should appear
to depend upon the bad air of the hospital, the patient
had better be exposed to the inclemency of the weather than
be allowed to remain in it.</p>

<p>In crowded hospitals, hemorrhages from the face of an
irritable stump are not unfrequent, and often cause a great
deal of trouble and distress. It is not a direct bleeding
from a vessel of sufficient size to be discovered and secured
by ligature, but an oozing from some part of the exposed
granulations, which are soft, pale, and flaccid. On making
pressure on them the hemorrhage ceases, but shortly after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reappears, and even becomes dangerous. This hemorrhage
is usually preceded by pain, heat, and throbbing in the surface
from which it proceeds. There is irritation of the habit
generally, and a tendency to direct debility. The proper
treatment consists in the removal of the patient to the open
air, with an antiphlogistic regimen in the first instance, followed
by the use of quinine and acids; cold to the stump,
in the shape of pounded ice or iced water. Escharotic and
stimulating applications should be used with caution. If
any of the styptics which are sometimes announced as infallible
could be relied upon, their application in these cases
would be most advantageous. The solution of the perchloride
of iron is the best.</p>

<p class="h2sub">APHORISMS FOR AMPUTATIONS, ETC.</p>

<p>65. Amputation of a limb is the last resource and the
opprobrium of surgery, as death is of the practice of physic;
it being, notwithstanding, impossible to do impossibilities,
and save a limb or a life which can no longer be preserved.
Art and science at that point cease to be useful.</p>

<p>66. At the commencement of the war in the Peninsula,
all surgeons believed it to be impossible to compress in an
effective manner the artery of the thigh against the bone, as
it passes over the edge of the pubes, and that the loss of
blood on its division must be so formidable as to be murderous.
This was merely a surgical delusion, which maintained
its ground in London until the end of 1815, when the French
soldier, whose thigh I had successfully taken off at the hip-joint,
after the battle of Waterloo, without first tying the
femoral artery, was shown to all disbelievers. It was the
great point in advance in English and European surgery,
and one great result of the practice of that war.</p>

<p>67. This great, indeed most important fact, having been
established, the surgery of amputation was deprived of
nearly all its terrors. Confidence, and with it coolness,
were obtained; and many young surgeons diligently sought
for an operation on the hip-joint as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
operative boldness and dexterity, much after the fashion of
the young lady <i>pianistes</i>, who do not consider themselves
in any way advanced on the road to perfection until they
can play at least the overture to <i>Guillaume Tell</i>, if not the
<i>Galop Chromatique</i> of Listz, nearly as well as the composer
himself.</p>

<p>68. As a tourniquet cannot be applied in this amputation,
nor even at that of the shoulder-joint, without doing harm,
its inutility in the greatest operations is proved; and recourse
should not be had to it in the smaller or less dangerous
ones, provided sufficient assistance can be obtained.
When the surgeon has only one assistant, he should apply
a tourniquet, or even if he should have several bad ones on
whom he cannot depend.</p>

<p>69. There is always more blood lost, and particularly in
secondary amputations, when a tourniquet is used than when
the principal artery is compressed by one assistant, and two
others are ready to press on the outside of the flaps, or upon
the divided vessels, with the ends of their fingers; the force
necessary to prevent the passage of blood through the common
femoral, or the axillary artery, being merely that of the
finger and thumb, applied in a very gentle manner, or even
of the end of the forefinger of a competent person. I have
rarely applied a tourniquet since 1812, and few persons have
done more formidable operations under more difficult circumstances.
The ancient illusion with regard to the necessity
for tourniquets in amputation must be given up, except
by incompetent persons, or by those who are fearful and superstitious,
and do not like to depart from the ways of their
forefathers.</p>

<p>70. A tourniquet is useful when loosely applied after an
operation, and the attendant should be taught how to turn
it, so as to suppress any serious bleeding which may take
place until the surgeon can be procured. It may be, although
it rarely is, necessary on the field of battle. The
surgeon need not, therefore, load himself or his assistant, as
formerly, with a sackful, for a thoroughly useful tourniquet
can be made in a moment with a pebble and a pocket-handkerchief,
or a roller. The great point is to know where and
how to apply it. When gentlemen called surgeons by warrant
are sent to an army, as many were to that in Spain and
France, with only the knowledge of a druggist, having been
refused a commission on account of their ignorance, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
necessary this instruction should be especially given to them;
and this horrible fact is recorded with the hope it may be
useful in preventing any such atrocious proceedings in future.
Peace or humane societies, if they cannot prevent
a war, may interfere with advantage on this point, to divest
it of some of its horrors. At the battle of Inkerman, a
young officer, the son of a friend of mine, was wounded in
the leg by a musket-ball, which caused much loss of blood.
A tourniquet was applied, instead of the required operation
being performed, and he was sent on board a transport from
Balaklava. The leg mortified, as a matter of course, and
was amputated. He died, an eternal disgrace to British
surgery, or rather to the nation which will not pay sufficiently
able men, and therefore employs ignorant ones&mdash;the best
they can get for the money.</p>

<p>71. When circular operations were performed in the olden
time, particularly on the thigh, the skin, when divided, was
dissected, and turned up like the cuff of a coat&mdash;a painful
proceeding, as unnecessary as it was barbarous. Forty
years have elapsed since I demonstrated its absurdity, and
showed that the first incision in the thigh should include the
fascia lata, any deep attachments it might have should follow,
when the parts thus divided ought to be retracted as a
whole, to form a proper covering for the stump.</p>

<p>It was at the same time shown that, in whatever way, and
however clumsily and tediously, the muscles might be divided,
it did not prevent the successful result of the operation,
provided the bone was cut short, so as to form a cone,
with an elongated or depressed point.</p>

<p>72. The nicking of the periosteum, and pushing it upward
and downward, so as to leave a space for the saw,
was at the same time forbidden, as leading to necrosis of the
part of the bone thus denuded, if unremoved by the saw.
The saw was also directed to be held perpendicularly to, and
not across, the bone, nor even diagonally to it&mdash;an apparently
trivial, but yet great improvement. The last part
divided is an outer and thin layer of hard bone, which does
not so readily splinter on the side as on the under part, by
the weight of the leg.</p>

<p>73. The limb to be amputated is not to be held by the
assistant in the manner described and usually shown in
books: one hand ought not to be above the knee, but below
and by the side of it, the other grasping the calf, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the limb may be duly supported, and drawn inward or outward,
in the opposite direction to the saw, as it divides the
last layers of the bone.</p>

<p>74. The common integuments of the stump should be
drawn together, in primary amputations, by sutures formed
of flexible leaden wires; by threads of silk, if leaden wires
be not attainable. The vessels which bleed should be carefully
secured by single yet fine threads of dentists’ or other
strong silk, one end to be cut off in primary amputations.
In secondary amputations, when the parts are not always
sound, both ends of the ligature should be cut off, and in such
cases the edges of the wound should be brought in contact
only, with a layer of fine linen between them, without the
expectation of, or the desire for, union taking place.</p>

<p>75. The removal of a limb should not occupy two minutes,
but the securing the blood-vessels should be done without
reference to time; when carefully effected, there is little
fear of secondary bleeding, and the stump should be closed
at once. It has been lately recommended not to close the
stump for four, six, or eight hours after the operation; but
this is not advisable, unless the depressed state of the patient,
or other causes, should have rendered it impossible to
secure, in a proper manner, all the vessels which are likely
to bleed. It will be less painful and dangerous to delay, in
such cases, than to have to reopen the stump.</p>

<p>76. When the edges of the incision have been brought
together by the hands of the assistants, and by the sutures
indicated, strips of some kind of agglutinative plaster without
resin should be applied between them, and a little wet
lint over the incision, retained by two cross-pieces of rollers,
the ends of which are maintained in their situation by another
roller applied round the body and over the upper part
of the thigh, including the extremities of the two cross-pieces;
but this roller is not to be applied over the end of
the stump. When the war came well in, stump-caps, as
they were called, went out, being worse than useless. The
stump should be supported on a soft pillow, so as to be as
comfortable as possible, and protected by a cradle from accidental
injury.</p>

<p>If inflammation, accompanied by pain, should take place,
cold or iced water should be applied, particularly in primary
amputations. In secondary ones, warm fomentations or light
warm poultices will be more advantageous, all constriction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by sutures or plasters being removed, the parts being simply
approximated to each other. Attention should be paid to
the directions in aphorism 61.</p>

<h3 class="center">AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT.</h3>

<p>77. This amputation essentially owes its existence to the
wars of the French Revolution. M. Bourgery says Blandin
performed it three times in 1794; once successfully. Baron
Larrey did it seven times during his different campaigns, and
he says one or two persons who had survived were seen
during their cure by an officer in Russian Poland, but they
never reached France. Nevertheless, I always assume that
one at least did recover, whether he was really seen or not,
being a compliment and a reward justly due to the zeal and
ability of my old friend the Baron, to whom the surgery of
France is so much indebted. This operation was first done
in Spain by the late Mr. Brownrigg, at Elvas, in 1811, and
by myself after the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, but none of
our patients ultimately recovered. I operated on a French
soldier at Brussels soon after the receipt of the injury at
Waterloo; he survived; and he was the first and the <i>only
man</i> seen for a long time afterward in either London or
Paris. The biographer of Baron Larrey says he was present
at, and advised the operation to be done; but that is an
error, as the Baron did not visit Brussels until after I had
left it for Antwerp; neither had I any knowledge of the
Baron’s writings in 1811 or 1812, when my first operation
was done in Portugal. Eighteen or twenty ways have been
suggested for doing this operation, and twenty persons are
believed to have survived its performance, several of whom
may be living at the present time.</p>

<p>A very extensive destruction of the soft parts, the femur
remaining entire, does not authorize the removal of the limb
in the first instance, unless the main artery be also injured.
Captain Flack, of the 88th Regiment, was struck by a large
cannon-shot at Ciudad Rodrigo, on the outside and anterior
part of the left thigh, which tore up and carried away nearly
all the soft parts from the groin, or bend of the thigh, below
Poupart’s ligament, to within a hand’s-breadth of the knee.
It was an awful affair. He was supposed to be dying, was
returned dead, and his commission was given to another.
Left to die in the field hospital after the town was stormed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and finding himself thus deserted by his own friends, he
claimed my aid as a stranger. I took him five leagues to
my hospital at Aldea del Obispo. The femoral artery lay
bare for the space of nearly four inches, in a channel at the
bottom of the wound; the whole, however, gradually closed
in, and he recovered.</p>

<p>If the injury is on the back part, a flap should be made
in amputation from the fore part. If the wound should be
on the outside, the flap is to be made from the inside, and
<i>vice versa</i>, the object being to make the stump as long as
possible. A wound of the artery, accompanied by a fracture
of the femur, requires amputation, for although many
would survive either injury alone, none would, it may be apprehended,
surmount both united.</p>

<p>If after a fracture in course of treatment, the principal
artery should be wounded by some accidental motion of the
bone, amputation should in general be resorted to. A ligature
on the artery higher up would fail, and the operation
of seeking for both ends of the injured vessel would cause
so much mischief in an unsound part that the consequences
would in all probability be fatal.</p>

<p>78. When the femur is suffering from a malignant disease,
commencing in the periosteum, or in its cancellated internal
structure, I am reluctantly obliged to say, from experience,
that the removal of the whole bone at the hip-joint offers
the best, perhaps the only chance of success. In such cases,
the operator has in general the power of selecting his mode
of proceeding.</p>

<p>It may be laid down as a principle in all cases of accident,
whether from shot, shell, or railway carriages, that no man
should suffer amputation at the hip-joint when the thigh-bone
is entire. It should never be done in cases of injury
when the bone can be sawn through immediately below the
trochanter major, and sufficient flaps can be preserved to
close the wound thus made. An injury warranting this operation
should extend to the neck, or head of the bone, and
it may be possible, as I have proposed, even then to avoid it
by removing the broken parts.</p>

<p>79. The principle being established, as a general rule in
all cases of recent injury, that the femur must be broken at
least as high as the trochanter to constitute an imperative
case for this operation, the next point of importance relates
to the manner of forming the first incisions. The
instruc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>tions
and recommendations to be found in books for the performance
of this operation are frequently inapplicable, and
are not to be depended upon; the errors occurring from the
operation having been considered and performed on the dead
body and not on the living; on the normal and not on the
injured state of parts. Thus, for instance, it is recommended
that an assistant should rotate the knee outward or inward,
to show the head of the femur; to which recommendation
there is the insuperable objection, that no person should
suffer this operation who has a knee, or half a thigh, or
even a third of one, to move by the rotary process. Pure
theorists in surgery have decided upon having a large flap
made on the fore part of the thigh, and a smaller one behind,
regardless of the fact that this cannot be done in many
cases requiring a primary operation from the nature of the
injury; although it may be done in many secondary cases, in
which this severe operation would not have been required if
the limb had been amputated in the first instance. It is the
mode recommended by Mr. Brownrigg, who in his operations,
which were secondary ones, had a choice of integument,
and it is, perhaps, under these circumstances, the best.</p>

<p>Baron Larrey tied the femoral artery in the first instance,
and then made two lateral flaps; but this operation, dependent
on the fear of hemorrhage, was never performed
in the British army.</p>

<p>80. My first successful operation, performed in 1815, was
done from without inward, the flaps being anterior and posterior,
the artery being compressed against the pubis.</p>

<p>The patient is to be laid on a low table, or other convenient
thing, in a horizontal position; an assistant, standing
behind and leaning over, compresses the external iliac artery
becoming femoral, as it passes over the edge of the pubis.
The surgeon, standing on the inside, commences his first incision
some three or four inches directly below the anterior
spinous process of the ilium, carries it across the thigh
through the integuments, inward and backward, in an oblique
direction, at an equal distance from the tuberosity of
the ischium to nearly opposite the spot where the incision
commenced; the end of this incision is then to be carried
upward with a gentle curve behind the trochanter, until it
meets with the commencement of the first; the second incision
being rather less than one-third the length of the first.
The integuments, including the fascia, being retracted, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
three gluteal muscles are to be cut through to the bone.
The knife being then placed close to the retracted integuments,
should be made to cut through everything on the
anterior part and inside of the thigh. The femoral or other
large artery should then be drawn out by a tenaculum or
spring forceps, and tied. The capsular ligament being well
opened, and the ligamentum teres divided, the knife should
be passed behind the head of the bone thus dislocated, and
made to cut its way out, care being taken not to have too
large a quantity of muscle on the under part, or the integuments
will not cover the wound, under which circumstance
a sufficient portion of muscular fiber must be cut away. The
obturatrix, gluteal, and ischiatic arteries are not to be feared,
being each readily compressed by a finger until they can be
duly secured. The capsular ligament, and as much of the
ligamentous edge of the acetabulum as can be readily cut
off, should be removed. The nerves, if long, are to be cut
short. The wound is then to be carefully cleansed, and
brought together by three or more soft leaden sutures in a
line from the spine of the ilium toward the tuberosity of the
ischium. The ligatures are to be brought out between the
sutures, and some adhesive strips of plaster applied to support
them. A little wet lint is to be placed over the wound,
and some well-adapted compress under the lower flap; the
whole to be retained by a soft bandage. In my successful
case there was a shot-hole in the under flap, which did good
service; and from having seen its use, I have no objection to
a small perpendicular slit being made in the lower flap, and
a strip of linen introduced to prevent adhesion. The immediate
union of the flaps cannot be expected, nor is it often
to be desired.</p>

<p>This mode of proceeding is more certain of making good
flaps where integuments are scarce. Where the integuments
will admit of the anterior flap being made by the
sharp-pointed puncturing knife dividing the parts after it
has been passed across from without inward, there is no
objection to this proceeding, and some prefer it. I have
had two such knives added to each of the cases of instruments
supplied to the army for the purpose.</p>

<p>Professor Langenbeck, when lately in London, informed
me he had performed amputation at the hip-joint several
times in the Holstein war, and he believed more than once
successfully; making the anterior flap by the pointed knife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
cutting from within outward, but the posterior one by cutting
through the integuments from without inward, as I
have recommended in high amputation below the joint, in
order to make the flap of a more equal and proper thickness.
One point to be attended to is to leave as little as
possible of the internal tendinous structure of the great
gluteus muscle, as it does not readily unite with other parts;
a second, not to leave too much muscle on the under part;
and a third, to remove as much as possible of the ligamentous
structure about the joint. The after-treatment will
be the same as in other formidable cases. The shock, however,
of the injury, and of the amputation, will render blood-letting
unnecessary. Cordials, in small quantities, with
opiates and a good but light nourishing diet, should be
given. The wound should be wetted with cold water, and
the patient constantly watched, so that hemorrhage may be
arrested if it should take place. In an otherwise successful
operation performed by Mr. C. G. Guthrie, at the Westminster
Hospital, the patient was lost on the third day from
this cause.</p>

<p>Mr. Brownrigg’s operation is to be done in the following
manner: The patient is to be placed on a low table and
properly secured, with the nates projecting over its edge, the
artery being compressed. The surgeon enters the pointed
knife between the spine of the ilium and the trochanter
major, and carries it across the thigh, as near as may be to
the head and neck of the femur, until the point appears on
the inside, near the scrotum, which should have been previously
drawn away. The knife is to cut slowly downward,
to make a flap, under which, and behind the knife, an assistant
inserts his four fingers, in order to be able to grasp the
flap and aid in compressing the principal artery, as the
operator completes the flap, which it is intended should be
a large one, as shown in the diagram, fig. 1.</p>

<p>The assistant holding up the flap, the surgeon cuts the
attachment of the gluteus medius muscle, from the upper
edge of the trochanter, if it has not been already done, opens
the capsular ligament of the joint, and divides the ligamentum
teres. The head of the bone can then be readily
withdrawn from the acetabulum. The knife being placed
behind the head of the bone and the trochanter, should be
carried obliquely downward and backward, so as to form a
shorter flap behind than was made before. The amputations
of the hip-joint, performed in the Crimea, have not, I
understand, been as successful as the ability with which they
were performed might have led the operators to expect.</p>

<p>81. Amputation by the circular incision is to be done in
the following manner: When a tourniquet is used, which it
should not be, if the surgeon can depend on his assistants,
the pad should be firm and narrow, and carefully held directly
over the artery, while the ends of the bandage in which it is
contained are pinned together. The strap of the tourniquet
is then to be put round the limb, the instrument itself being
directly over the pad, with the screw entirely free; the strap
is then to be drawn tight and buckled on the outside, so as
to prevent its slipping, and yet not to interfere with the
screw. Should the screw require to be turned more than
half its number of turns, the strap is not sufficiently tight,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
or the pad has not been well applied. The patient being
placed on a table at a convenient height, the assistants are
carefully to retract the integuments upward, and put them
on the stretch downward, by which means their division is
more easily and regularly accomplished. The surgeon,
standing on the outside, passes his hand under the thigh
and round above quite to the outside, and there he begins
his incision with the heel of the knife, and with a quick,
steady movement, carries it round the thigh until the circular
division of the skin, cellular membrane, and fascia has been
completed. The skin cannot be sufficiently retracted unless
the fascia be divided, and as the division of the skin is certainly
the most painful part of the operation, it ought never
to be done by two incisions, when the largest thigh can most
readily and speedily be encircled by one. If the fascia
should not be completely divided by the first circular incision,
it is to be cut with the point of the knife, together
with any attachment to the bone or muscles beneath. The
amputating knife is then to be applied close to the retracted
fascia and integuments, and the outermost muscles are to be
divided by a circular incision, with any portion of the fascia
that may not have equally retracted. This incision completed,
the knife is immediately to be placed close to the
edge of the muscular fibers which have retracted, and the
remainder of the soft parts divided to the bone in the same
manner. In making these two incisions, care should be
taken to cut at least half an inch on each side of the great
artery by one incision, which should be either the first or
second, as may be most convenient. The muscles attached
to the bone are then to be separated with a scalpel for
about three inches in large thighs, by which means the bone
will be fairly imbedded when sawed off. The common linen
retractor is next to be placed on the limb, and the muscles
steadily kept back while the bone is sawed through. The
periosteum may or may not be divided by one circular cut
of the scalpel after the retractor has been put on. The heel
of the saw is then to be applied and drawn toward the surgeon,
so as to mark the bone, in which furrow he will continue
to cut with long and steady strokes, the point of the
saw slanting downward in a perpendicular direction until the
bone be nearly divided, when the saw is to be more lightly
pressed upon, to avoid splintering it, which this manner of
sawing will also tend to prevent. During this operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the thigh should be held steadily above, and in such a manner
below that the part to be cut off does not weigh or drag
on the bone above; at the same time it must not be pressed
inward or upward, or it will prevent the motion of the saw
or splinter the bone. The retractor is then to be removed,
the great artery to be pulled out by a tenaculum passed
through its sides, separated a little from its attachments, and
firmly tied with a two-threaded, strong ligature, provided
dentists’ silk be not used, and the tenaculum is not to be
withdrawn until this has been accomplished; any other vessels
that show themselves may be secured, and compression
should for an instant be taken off the main artery, when
others will start. If used, the tourniquet should now be
removed, and the small remaining vessels will be discovered.
If the great vein continue to bleed after some pressure has
been made upon it, a single-threaded ligature should be put
over it; but this should not be done if it can be avoided,
and only when the loss of a little blood might be dangerous.
If the cancellated part of the bone bleed freely, the thumb of
the left hand pressed steadily upon it, while the vessels are
tying, will in a short time suppress the hemorrhage. Any
inequality of bone should be removed by forceps. The ligatures
should now be shortened, one end of each thread being
cut off; the stump is to be sponged with cold water and
dried, the bandage rolled steadily down the thigh; the muscles
and integuments brought forward and placed in apposition,
horizontally across the face of the stump, and retained
by leaden sutures and adhesive plasters carefully applied,
from below upward, and from above downward; the ligatures
being brought out nearly as straight as possible, in two
or three places between the slips of plaster, unless both ends
have been cut short. A compress of lint is to be placed over
and under the wound, supported by two slips of bandage, in
the form of a Maltese cross, vertically and horizontally, and
the whole secured by a few more turns of the bandage. No
stump-cap is to be applied; the stump is to be raised a little
on a proper pillow from the bed, in which the patient lies
on his back; and if the bone appear to press too much
against the upper flap, the body may be a little raised,
which will relieve it.</p>

<p>In secondary amputation of the thigh, the integuments
may not be sound, and will not retract, in which case they
must be dissected back to an equal distance all round. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the muscles are much diminished in size, or flabby, they
should be left even longer than may appear necessary for
the formation of a good stump; and this is to be done more
especially on the under part, for the bone will frequently
protrude under these circumstances, when enough has been
supposed to have been preserved. In all these cases the
bone should be shorter than usual, and the skin should, if
possible, retain its attachments to the parts beneath. No
inconvenience can ever arise from too much muscle and skin
in a circular stump; but it does sometimes from too much
skin alone.</p>

<p>In primary operations there will be from three to seven
vessels to be tied; in secondary ones, from ten to sixteen,
and even then there may be an oozing from the stump. In
this case a little delay in searching for the vessels is necessary;
the tourniquet and all tight bandages should be removed,
and the stump well sponged with cold water before
it is dressed. A certain degree of oozing is to be expected
from all stumps, although it does not always occur: but
when there is really any hemorrhage, so that blood distills
freely through the dressings, the stump should be opened,
when the bleeding vessel will generally be discovered readily,
though not visible before. A stump under these circumstances
should not be closed in the first instance; the parts
should be merely approximated until all bleeding has ceased.</p>

<p>When the operation is performed near the knee, the
gradual thickening of the thigh prevents the retraction of
the integuments, and has an effect upon the vessels of the
stump; both of which evils are avoided after the circular
incision has been completed, by making a cut, an inch and a
half in length, in the integuments through the fascia on each
side, in the horizontal direction in which they are recommended
to be placed, after the operation is finished; but
this will very rarely be necessary.</p>

<p>82. Amputation of the thigh, by the flap operation, is
best accomplished by the method adopted by Mr. Luke, of
the London Hospital, which is as follows: The patient
being placed so that the thigh projects beyond the table,
the surgeon stands with his left hand toward the body, or
on the outside when amputating the right, and on the inside
when amputating the left thigh. The knife to be used
ought to be narrow, pointed, and longer by two or three
inches than the diameter of the thigh at the place of
ampu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>tation.
The point of the knife should be entered <i>mid</i>-distance
between the anterior and posterior surfaces of the
thigh, which may be effected with accuracy, if the eye is
brought to a level with the thigh, when the middle point is
easily determined. The posterior flap is to be formed first,
by carrying the knife transversely through the thigh, so that
its point shall come out on the opposite side, exactly midway
between the anterior and posterior surfaces. In traversing
the thigh, the knife should pass behind the bone, and will
be more or less remote from it in different individuals, according
to the greater or less development of the posterior
muscles, when, by cutting obliquely downward, to the extent
of from four to six inches, according to the thickness of the
thigh, a posterior flap is formed. The anterior flap is
effected, not by making a flap, but by commencing an incision
through the integuments and muscles on the side of
the thigh opposite to the surgeon, at a little distance anterior
to the extremity of the posterior flap. This incision is
made from without inward, through the integuments, so as
to form an even curve, and without angular irregularity,
over the thigh, to near the base of the posterior flap on the
side on which the surgeon stands. The length of this flap
is determined by that of the posterior. It will therefore
vary from four to six inches, as before stated; and for its
completion will require a second, or perhaps a third, application
of the knife. In the two flaps thus made, the division
of almost all the soft structures is included, a few only immediately
surrounding the bone remaining uncut. These are
to be divided by a circular sweep of the knife, at the part
where it is intended to saw the bone; in this way it is sufficiently
denuded for the application of the saw. The flaps
being held back by an assistant, the bone is to be sawn
through in the usual way. In amputations of the lower
part of the thigh it usually happens that the ischiatic nerve
lies upon the surface of the posterior flap, and should be
removed. It occasionally occurs, although not frequently,
that the popliteal artery is cut obliquely at its commencement;
but in amputations above the passage of the arterial
trunk through the tendon of the triceps, this does not take
place, the division of the artery being usually included in
the circular sweep made after the formation of the flaps.
The divided arteries having been carefully secured, the flaps
are to be brought together and retained by three sutures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
passed through the integuments at equal distances from
each other, and from the extremity or base of the flaps. It
appears to be a matter of considerable importance not only
that their edges should be kept in apposition, but that their
<i>whole surfaces</i> should be kept in accurate contact. For
this purpose, the following method of dressing is adopted:
The edges, in the intervals between the sutures, are to be
held together by strips of adhesive plaster about one inch in
breadth. A compress of lint is then to be fitted over each
flap, that upon the posterior being the larger. The compresses
are to cover the flaps only, and not to extend over
the extremity of the bone, where their pressure would probably
be ill endured. The posterior compress is made large,
that it may serve as a cushion on which the thigh rests
when the patient is placed in bed. The compresses are to
be retained in position by one or two strips of plaster, and
supported by a bandage applied carefully round the stump.
If this be properly accomplished, the whole surfaces of the
flaps will be kept accurately in contact with each other, and
complete union may be reasonably expected. By securing
the perfect apposition and support of the entire surfaces in
accurate contact, the disposition to the issue of blood from
small vessels is also obviated to a great extent, and it is
even probable that vessels of a larger diameter than the
smallest, which would bleed if not restrained, are, by the
pressure of the opposing surface, prevented from doing so,
and the probability of secondary hemorrhage is diminished.
Experience has demonstrated the fact that primary union of
the flaps is most effectually procured in the great majority
of amputations thus treated. Indeed, non-union of the flaps
is the exception; union, the rule. In the subsequent treatment
of the stump, care must be taken to prevent an accumulation
of discharge in the tracks of the ligatures; and
the dressings must be renewed according to circumstances
having reference to the quantity of discharge, and the uneasiness
of the patient. The line of division of the integuments
of the two flaps is situated, at first, in the center of
the face of the stump; but when the flaps have united, a
gradual change takes place in the position of the cicatrix:
it recedes, by degrees, to the posterior aspect of the thigh,
and the bone abuts upon the anterior flap, by which alone it
is eventually covered, and the cicatrix is thus removed from
its pressure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
83. A protrusion of bone is a disagreeable occurrence
after amputation; it will sometimes happen after sloughing
of the stump, without any fault of the operator. If, on
completing the operation, it is evident the bone cannot be
well covered, a sufficient portion should be at once sawn off,
and the error remedied.</p>

<p>When the bone protrudes at a subsequent period to the
extent of an inch or more, it should be removed by operation,
an incision being made on, and down to, the bone, and
the saw applied where it is sound. The chain saw, when at
hand, answers well, and some should be supplied for the use
of the principal hospitals with every army. The protruded
end of bone should be held steadily by pincers, or it may
be introduced into a hollow tube, which fixes it firmly.</p>

<p>When the bone has been badly sawn through, or split in
the act of dividing the last layer, or the periosteum is unduly
separated, the end will often exfoliate with the split,
which may extend up for several inches, giving rise to the
formation of abscesses, causing much suffering, and occupying
a great length of time before the ring of bone and the
split portion exfoliate, and the stump becomes quite sound.
A splinter of this kind may even require to be removed at
a late or at a distant period, from the nervous irritation and
suffering it may occasion. This irritation has been often
attributed to the extremity of the principal nerve, which
always enlarges, assumes a bulbous form, and is painful on
pressure, when made for the purpose, although not so under
ordinary circumstances. This enlargement never requires
removal, unless it should adhere to the cicatrix, or be the
subject of disease incidentally occasioned in it. The great
sciatic nerve became early thus enlarged in the thigh of
the late Marquess of Anglesea, and was mistaken for disease,
for which he was advised to have it removed, it being
painful on pressure, and therefore the supposed cause of the
tic douloureux under which he labored. Consulted on the
propriety of this operation, his leg-maker, Mr. Pott, being
present, who had also lost a leg above the knee, I requested
his lordship to squeeze Mr. Pott’s bulbous nerve, in the same
manner as the doctor had squeezed his lordship. He did
so, and Mr. Pott roared and sprang from the floor in a
manner which quite satisfied Lord Anglesea.</p>

<p class="h2sub">REMOVAL OF THE HEAD OF THE FEMUR, ETC.</p>

<p>84. The removal of the head of the thigh-bone from its
place in the hip-joint, after it has been separated in a measure
from its attachments by disease of a scrofulous nature,
is an operation which has been several times successfully
performed, and life has been thereby preserved without much
suffering or risk to the patient. In this case, the head of
the bone is found lying outside the cavity, from which it has
been drawn by the action of the muscles. A step further
must be taken, and this operation must some day be done in
cases of fracture of the head or neck of this bone caused by
an external wound&mdash;cases which have hitherto been invariably
fatal, or in which life has been preserved by amputation
at the hip-joint.</p>

<p>The great advance which operative surgery has made
within the last forty years, and the success which has followed
the removal of the head of the humerus, the whole
of the elbow, the ankle, and even the knee-joint, render it
imperative on surgeons of ability to endeavor to save life
without the performance of so formidable an operation as
that of the removal of the whole limb, more particularly
when the health is good and the parts sound, with the exception
of those immediately injured.</p>

<p>The cases which seem more particularly favorable for this
operation are those in which the head or neck of the bone
is broken by a musket-ball. Picture to yourselves a man
lying with a small hole either before or behind in the thigh,
no bleeding, no pain, nothing but an inability to move the
limb, to stand upon it, and think that he must inevitably die
in a few weeks, worn out by the continued pain and suffering
attendant on the repeated formation of matter burrowing
in every direction, unless his thigh be amputated at the
hip-joint, or he be relieved by the operation which, I insist
upon it, ought first to be performed.</p>

<p>85. In order to do this operation with precision, the surgeon
should make himself well acquainted with the anatomy
of the parts; and as the war in the Russian Empire may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
offer opportunities for its performance, a recapitulation of
the essential points to be noticed may be useful. Two limbs
should be injected so as to show the great arteries distinctly,
and one should be dissected so that every part may be brought
into view at once. That being done, attention should be
directed to two points, the great trochanter and the round
head of the thigh-bone in its socket, which is directly below
and a little internal to the anterior superior spinous process
of the ilium.</p>

<p>When the thigh is bent in the dissected limb, the head of
the bone will be seen rolling in the socket very distinctly,
and, in order to lay it bare for removal, the muscles, etc.
around it must be divided. The first, on the anterior and
outer part, is the tensor vaginæ femoris; this should be divided;
outside this the gluteus medius must be cut, going
to be inserted into the upper and outer part of the top of
the great trochanter; deeper, and between these two last,
lies the gluteus minimus, winding forward to be inserted into
the anterior portion of the same part. Now, let the great
gluteus muscle be cut through backward in a curve, and the
insertions of four muscles at one part&mdash;viz., the pit or fossa
immediately behind the great trochanter&mdash;will be brought
into view: these are the pyriformis, the gemelli, reckoned
as one muscle, and the obturatores externus and internus.
They should all be cut through within half an inch from
their insertion. The square muscle lying or placed immediately
below them, and running from the ischium to the
inter-trochanteric line, is the quadratus femoris; it must be
cut across. The head of the femur will now be seen to roll
in the socket on the least motion being given to the knee.
The surgeon should then open into the exposed joint with
great care, when by a gentle rotation of the knee inward the
head of the thigh-bone will be readily dislocated outward.
The ligamentum teres, or the round ligament, as it is termed,
although it is triangular at its origin, should now be divided,
with as much of the capsular ligament as may be necessary,
when everything will be ready for the application of the
saw.</p>

<p>Pause a moment, and view the parts before the saw is
applied. Two strong muscles are inserted into the small
trochanter by a common tendon, the iliacus internus and
psoas magnus. This insertion should remain untouched if
the fracture should not extend below the little trochanter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
It is not always necessary to injure them, and they will be
of great use afterward, if the operation should prove successful.
If the neck of the bone be broken through, rotating
the thigh as directed may not assist much in dislocating
its head. But then, the separation of the fractured parts
may be readily completed, and the piece detached, when the
remaining part of the head of the bone will be more easily
removed. The sawing may be accomplished with the greatest
ease by a small common saw, or by the improved chain
saw, which will do good service. The arteries to be divided
are all of small size. Filled with red injection, they are so
small as scarcely to be seen; and they could not give any
trouble; for the wound is so large as to give easy access to
every part, and readily admit of any bleeding vessel being
tied without difficulty. The round ligament should be cut
off close to its origin in the acetabulum, and any portion of
the capsular ligament and cartilaginous edge of the acetabulum
which can be quickly removed with it, but no time
should be unnecessarily lost in trying to remove the cartilaginous
lining of the cavity itself, which will be gradually
absorbed. The sawn end of the femur should now be
brought up into the cavity, and kept there if possible by a
supporting splint and bandage, with the hope that it may
become rounded and adhere by a newly-formed ligamentous
structure, in the same manner as the end of the humerus
does to the glenoid cavity of the scapula, when similarly
treated. The edges of the wound are then to be brought
in apposition, and retained so by two or three sutures. The
gluteus magnus slides over the trochanter major, having a
bursa between them, and this part will not readily throw out
granulations. The surgeon may therefore be less solicitous
about the accuracy of the apposition of the edges at the
under part, through which the discharge will more easily
pass. The outside must, however, be supported by sticking-plaster
and bandage compress, to prevent any bagging, and
to keep all parts in contact. The saving the periosteum of
as much of the femur to be taken away, as strongly recommended
by MM. Flourens and Baudens in the excision of
the head of the humerus, should be attempted, although not
easy of execution. (<i>Aph. 118.</i>)</p>

<p>86. The surgeon should now do the operation on the undissected
limb. The first cut through the skin, integuments,
and fascia lata should be a curved one, beginning just over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the inner edge of the tensor vaginæ femoris muscle, as shown
on the other leg, curving downward and outward, so as to
pass across the bone an inch at least below the trochanter
major, when it should turn upward to the extent of three
inches or more, as the size of the limb may require. This
incision or flap should, when complete, divide, in addition to
the integuments, the fascia lata, the tensor vaginæ femoris,
and part of the gluteus maximus. The flap thus formed
must be raised or turned up by an assistant, to enable the
operator to get at and divide the parts below, in the order
before named. It is not necessary to stop to tie any bleeding
vessel until the operation is finished, for little or no blood
will be lost.</p>

<p>Pause again. The surgeon has just done nearly the
outer half of the operation as to cutting, for removing the
whole limb at the joint; and if he should now find that the
bone is so much shattered in the shaft that he cannot hope
to save the limb, there is no difficulty in removing it. To
do this, place your long knife inside the bone, with the middle
of its edge resting against the outer edge of the iliacus
and psoas muscles, and at one firm cut of a strong hand let
it cut its way inward, forming an inner flap, your assistant
steadily compressing the femoral artery against the bone
above. This artery and the great profunda will both be
divided; seize them with the finger and thumb of the left
hand, and place a ligature, or assist in placing one, on each
branch with the right; or, if the trunk of the profunda
should have been cut very short, tie the main trunk of the
femoral. Let the ligature be a single thread of strong dentists’
silk, with which I have successfully tied the common
iliac, and no fear need be entertained of its not holding fast
if you tie it reasonably tight. The idea usually entertained
that a great artery cannot be closed by the ordinary process
of nature under a ligature, if a branch be given off near it,
is erroneous. I never placed reliance on this opinion unless
in the accidental circumstance of the outside of the orifice
of the branch being in contact with the ligature, the irritation
caused by which outside may not be sufficient to close
the orifice within, and the common iliac artery of one of the
two cases in which I tied it successfully (the patient dying
a year afterward) may be seen in the Museum of the College
of Surgeons. It is tied about an inch from the aorta, and
was pervious on each side of the ligature, which has closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the vessel to no greater extent than its own width, proving
all the facts I have mentioned so frequently on this subject.
As to the smaller vessels, they will give no trouble, being
easily commanded, each by the point of a finger. I have
not done this operation of removing the head and neck of
the femur on a healthy living man after an accident, but it
must be done, and I am satisfied it will in the end succeed.
It was done in the 3d Division of the army in the Crimea
after the engagement of the 18th of June. The continuity
of the head with the shaft was not altogether destroyed,
the fracture being principally confined to the great trochanter
and the trochanteric ridge. It was at first thought
the operation might be dispensed with, but as great irritation
ensued, with every prospect of considerable mischief,
the head, neck, and both trochanters were excised. On the
6th of July the man was doing well, but unfortunately he
was attacked by cholera three days afterward, and died.
This operation has since been done by Mr. Blenkin, of the
Grenadier Guards; the result will be stated hereafter.</p>

<p>Amputation at the hip-joint should not be performed,
unless the head and neck of the thigh-bone be injured; and
it ought not to be done if they be, unless the shaft of the
thigh-bone be extensively broken also. The operation I
have recommended should be its substitute, and I hope yet
to see a man walking with ease and comfort on whom it has
been performed. The recommendation thus given is the
result of the experience of former times, of the whole of the
war in the Peninsula and at Waterloo, matured by that of
the last forty years in London hospitals, and by a due consideration
of the state of surgery throughout all civilized
Europe and America. Surgery is never stationary, and
surgeons of the present day must continue to show that it
is as much a science as an art.</p>

<p>87. Wounds of the knee-joint from musket-balls, with
fracture of the bones composing it, require immediate amputation;
for although a limb may be sometimes saved, it
cannot be called a recovery, or a successful result, where the
limb is useless, and is a constant source of irritation and
distress after several mouths of acute suffering have been
endured, to obtain even this partial relief from impending
death. For one limb thus saved, ten lives will be lost; and
the sufferer is often glad, after months and years have
elapsed, to lose the limb thus saved, more particularly when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the ball has lodged in the articulating surface of either of
the bones. Amputation at a secondary period, in these
cases, does not afford half the chance of success, for many
will not survive the inflammation and the fever which will
ensue. The amputation should therefore be immediate, unless
excision can be substituted for it, and it is a point to be
hereafter decided whether excision may not almost always
be so substituted when the wound is made by a musket-ball,
and the popliteal artery and nerve are not injured.</p>

<p>88. Compound fractures of the patella, without injury to
the other bones, admit of delay, provided the bone be not
much splintered. If the ball should have pierced the center
of the patella, and passed out nearly in an opposite direction
behind, the limb will not be saved. If the ball have
struck the patella on its edge, and gone through it transversely,
opening into the joint, it will very rarely be saved;
but if it be merely fractured, there is hope under the most
rigorous antiphlogistic treatment, and delay is proper. A
ball will occasionally penetrate the capsular ligament, and
lodge in the knee-joint, with little injury to the bones. If
it cannot be extracted without opening extensively into the
cavity of the joint, and the extraction of the ball is absolutely
necessary, amputation or excision had better be performed
at first, for it will be ultimately necessary. The
condyles of the femur and the lower part of the bone being
spongy, a ball may pass through them or between them,
and fall into the knee-joint, or it may make a prominence
on the side of the patella, without passing out, or immediately
interrupting the motion of the leg, for the soldier
may walk some distance afterward. The popliteal artery
may also be divided in addition, and either of these cases
will render amputation necessary, for the ball must be taken
out on the fore part, and the general inflammation of the
joint will either destroy the patient in a short time, or, after
much distress and hazard, leave him no alternative but
amputation. If a ball lodge in the condyles of the femur
within the capsular ligament, and cannot be easily extracted,
excision or amputation is advisable; for the limb, if preserved,
will not be a useful one. If the ball, on the other
hand, lodge without the capsular ligament, and cannot readily
be extracted, the wound should be healed as soon as possible;
and, although it may cause some little inconvenience
to the knee-joint, the limb and life of the patient may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
saved, as I have seen in many instances, when a continuance
of persevering efforts to extract the ball would have exposed
both to great danger. Many cases of wounds in the knee-joint,
in which the capsular ligament has been wounded, and
the articulation opened into without injury to the bones, do
well, such as simple incised wounds made with a clean cutting
instrument. The success attending all wounds of the
knee-joint depends entirely upon absolute rest, upon the
antiphlogistic mode of treatment being rigidly enforced, on
the healthy state of the atmosphere, and on the locality
being free from endemic disease. The limb is to be placed
in the straight position, a splint to be put beneath it, in
order to prevent any motion, and cold or iced water to be
applied, especially in summer, to diminish the increasing
heat. General bleeding may be had recourse to in sufficient
quantity to keep all general inflammatory action in due
bounds; but it is on local blood-letting that the surgeon
must principally rely for the prevention of inflammation.
Cupping can sometimes be performed with marked effect;
but leeches are more serviceable when they can be procured
in sufficient numbers; from twenty to forty, or more, may
be applied at a time; whenever the sensation of heat is felt,
and is accompanied by pain, they should be repeated until
these symptoms subside. The necessity for the local abstraction
of blood is so great that it should never be lost sight of
for a moment; for if suppuration take place throughout the
cavity of the joint, it is followed, in most instances, by ulceration
of the cartilages and caries of the bones. By local
and general bleeding, the application of cold, rigid abstinence,
and the straight position, a recovery may sometimes
be effected; but wounds of the knee-joint, however simple,
should always be considered as of a very dangerous nature,
infinitely more so than those of the shoulder, the elbow, or
the ankle. When a poultice is applied to a gunshot wound
of this kind, I consider it the precursor of amputation. Col.
Donnellan, of the 48th Regiment, was wounded, at the battle
of Talavera, in the knee-joint, by a musket-ball, which gave
him so little uneasiness that he could scarcely be persuaded
to proceed to the rear. At a little distance from the fire of
the enemy, we talked over the affairs of the moment, when,
tossing his leg about on his saddle, he declared he felt no
inconvenience from the wound, and would go back, as he
saw his corps was very much exposed. After he had stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
with me a couple of hours, I persuaded him to go into the
town. This injury, although at first to all appearance so
trifling, proceeded so rapidly as to prevent any relief at last
being obtained from amputation, and caused his death in a
few days.</p>

<p>89. <i>Excision</i> of the knee-joint is an operation formerly
attended with so little success that it has been but rarely
performed until lately. The result will, in all probability,
be more favorable in cases of injury from musket-balls, in
which the femur and tibia have both been much injured,
without so much mischief being inflicted on the soft parts
as would have rendered amputation necessary. In such
cases, provided every accommodation, and particularly absolute
rest and good air, can be obtained for the sufferer,
excision should be attempted, in preference to the amputation
recommended in 84 and 85. Some cases of success
have lately been published by Mr. Jones, of the island of
Jersey; some by Mr. Syme, Mr. Mackenzie, Dr. Gurdon
Buck, Mr. Fergusson, and others. Mr. Jones’s method of
operating is here transcribed, as sent to me by himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In my first case, the incisions were in this form <span class="sans-serif"><b>H</b></span>, two
lateral, one along each side of the joint, and a transverse
one immediately over the middle of the patella. The flaps
were then dissected upward and downward, the patella removed&mdash;and
I do not see that any advantage can be gained
by keeping it, even if not diseased&mdash;the crucial and lateral
ligaments were then divided, and the joint completely opened.
The leg was afterward bent backward on the thigh, and the
diseased portion of the femur was cleared, and removed with
an ordinary amputating saw. The same method was followed
with the tibia: the bones were then placed in juxtaposition,
the flaps brought together by means of a few
stitches, and the limb placed in a species of fracture-box.
Water-dressing was applied. In the second case, I followed
very nearly the same plan, with the exception of my
first incisions, which were made something in a horseshoe
shape. In the third case, I removed a considerable portion
of integument, and, I conceive, with marked advantage. In
the two former cases, I think the cure was protracted by
preserving all the diseased external parts.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gurdon Buck, of the United States of America, in a
case of anchylosis, with deformity, after a gunshot wound,
removed the knee-joint by a transverse incision from one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
condyle to the other across the lower margin of the patella.
A longitudinal incision intersected this, extending four inches
above and below it. The flaps being dissected up, the joint
was opened into by an incision across the ligamentum patellæ
at the inferior edge of the bone, and also across the
lateral ligaments. The adhesions of the articular surfaces
were broken up by forced flexion very gradually applied.
A slice was then removed with the common amputating saw
from the surface of the condyles of the femur, including the
pulley-like surface, care being taken to make this section on
a plane parallel with the surfaces of support upon which the
condyles rest, when the body is erect. The articular surface
of the tibia was next removed on a level with the upper
extremity of the fibula, after the insertions of the capsular
ligament had been dissected up from the posterior half of
the circumference of the head of the bone. The broad, fresh-cut
bony surfaces, which were very vascular and healthy,
admitted of accurate coaptation without stretching the tendons
and other parts in the ham. To secure them in close
contact, and prevent displacement, a flexible iron wire was
passed through both bones on either side, and the two ends
twisted and left out between the flaps of skin. The patella,
being disorganized and softened, was removed, except the
superior margin, which affords insertion to the quadriceps
muscle. The flaps of integument having been trimmed,
were brought together by sutures and adhesive plaster, and
the limb placed in a fracture-box. The constitutional fever
was moderate, and disappeared in a fortnight. Suppuration
never exceeded half an ounce daily. At the end of five
weeks and a half the wires became loose, and were removed.
No exfoliation followed. At the end of nine weeks the
wound had entirely healed, and the limb could be raised
bodily from the bed. There is no mobility between the
bones; the difference in the length of the limb, as compared
with the other, is one inch and a half, which permits the
foot to clear the surface of the ground, which cannot be
done when the limb is of the same length as the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones, since the publication of his original cases, has
in a subsequent one not only preserved the patella, but even
the ligamentum patellæ, which he considers to be a great
improvement when it can be effected; he operated in the
following manner: A longitudinal incision down to the
bone, four inches in extent, was made on each side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
knee-joint, midway between the vasti and the flexors of the
leg. These two cuts were then connected by a transverse
one just over the prominence of the tubercle of the tibia,
care being taken not to cut the ligamentum patellæ. The
flap was turned upward; the patella and its ligament were
freed, drawn over the internal condyle, and kept there by
means of a broad, flat, and turned-up spatula. The joint
was thus exposed, the synovial capsule was divided as far as
could be seen, when the leg was forcibly bent, the crucial
ligaments, almost breaking in the act, only required a slight
touch of the knife to divide them completely. The articular
surfaces of the bones were now completely brought into view,
when the diseased portions were removed by suitable saws,
the soft parts being kept aside by assistants; the external
condyle had been hollowed out by a large abscess, so that it
was necessary to saw off (obliquely) another portion of the
carious bone, and to gouge out the remainder, until the
healthy cancellous structure was reached. The articular
surface of the patella had also to be gouged until sound
bone was attained. The bones were brought into apposition,
and the patella and its ligament replaced, as nearly
as possible; at the end of seven weeks the patient, twelve
years old, was able to turn the limb from side to side, and
ultimately recovered.</p>

<p>This little boy I saw walking firmly on his leg, an admirable
instance of conservative surgery. It is, nevertheless, an
operation which ought not to be done on the field of battle,
unless perfect quiescence and every desired accommodation
can be obtained, and no endemic disease prevail.</p>

<p>90. Amputation of the leg is performed in two ways&mdash;by
the circular incision and by two flaps, the circular incision
being only applicable to the calf. In either way the stump
should, if possible, be seven inches long, for the more convenient
application of an artificial leg, which is now made
with a socket to fit the stump, instead of resting against
the bent knee, unless the stump be too short for its proper
adaptation otherwise.</p>

<p>The operation by the circular incision is performed by
necessity in the thick part of the leg, and the bone is usually
sawn through about four inches from the patella, so that,
when the stump has healed, there may be sufficient length
of bone left to support with steadiness the weight of the
body on the knee, and that greater facility may be given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the motion of the leg, from the preservation of the insertion
of the flexor tendons. The most eligible place for the application
of the tourniquet, when used, is about one-third of
the length of the thigh from the knee, on the inside, where
the artery perforates the tendon of the triceps muscle, and
where it can be most conveniently compressed against the
bone by a small firm pad, the instrument being on the outside,
or opposite the pad; or the compress may be placed
between the hamstring tendons, a little distance from the
hollow behind the joint, the instrument itself being on the
fore part of the thigh. In this method the pad must be
thicker, and the compression is more painful, and not more
secure. The surgeon should stand on the inside of the leg
to be operated upon, that he may more readily saw the
fibula at the same time as the tibia, by which the chance of
splintering the fibula is diminished; for this bone is held
much more steadily under the saw when the tibia is undivided,
whatever pains may otherwise be taken by the assistants
to secure it. The limb should be a little bent, and the
circular incision made with the smaller amputating knife
through the skin and integuments to the bone on the fore
part, and to the muscles on the outside and back part; and
as the attachment of the skin to the bone will not readily
allow its retraction, it must be dissected back all round, and
separated from the fascia, the division of which in the first
incision would avail nothing, from its strong attachments to
the parts beneath. The muscles are then to be cut through,
nearly on a level with the first incision, down to the bones.
The interosseous ligament between the tibia and fibula is
to be divided with the catlin; and as several of the muscles
cannot retract in consequence of their attachment to the
bones, they are to be separated with the knife; in the same
manner the inter-muscular septa, or expansions running between
them, are to be divided, as they would else prevent
their retraction. The retractor with three slips is now to
be put on, the center slip running between the bones, by
which the soft parts may be pulled back to a sufficient distance,
any adhering part being divided by the point of the
knife. The bones are to be sawn through with the usual
precautions, and the retractor removed, when the three principal
arteries should be secured: the anterior tibial, on the
fore part of the interosseous ligament, between the tibia
and fibula; the peroneal artery behind the fibula; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
posterior tibial near it, more inward and behind the tibia;
this artery will frequently, however, contract very much, and
will only show itself on the compression being taken off the
artery above. It in general causes more trouble to secure
it than the others, and I have two or three times seen, even
in London hospitals, the needle dipped round it in despair,
when merely pulling out the artery with the tenaculum, and
dissecting a little round it, would have shown the small retracted
bleeding vessels arising from it, and have prevented,
in all probability, a secondary hemorrhage. The tourniquet,
if used, being removed, the smaller vessels tied, and the stump
sponged with cold water and dried, the integuments and
muscles should be brought forward as much as possible, and
the strips of adhesive plaster applied from side to side&mdash;that
is, the wound is to be closed vertically or nearly so, that the
strips of plaster may not in any way press upon the fore
part of the tibia, by which its protrusion will be avoided,
an occurrence which almost invariably follows when the line
of approximation is horizontal and the strips of plaster press
upon the bone. If the spine of the tibia be sharp, it should
be removed by the saw, whether the operation be done by
the circular incision or by the use of flaps.</p>

<p>91. The flap operation, as performed by Mr. Luke, differs
from that of the thigh in some particulars. There is
a greater variety in the proportion which the soft parts in
the posterior flap bear to those in the anterior, and the distance
from the bones at which the limb is transfixed in the
first step of the operation is subject to such variety that,
when the calf is large, the mid-point for the introduction of
the knife lies at some distance from the posterior aspect of
the bones; in a small calf, it is close to it. The course of
the knife through the limb is oblique instead of transverse,
for the purpose of accommodating the line of incision to the
plane of the two bones. The anterior flap is formed in the
same way as in the thigh amputation, but it has proportionately
more integuments and is thinner; yet its base and
length are rendered equal to the base and length of the posterior
flap, and may be adjusted evenly with it when the
stump is dressed. In the circular division of the remaining
soft parts, after the formation of the flaps, there is a necessary
variation in the proceedings, from the circumstance of
there being two bones united by interosseous membrane.
It may, however, be accomplished by sweeping the knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
around the more distant bone of the two, its point being
afterward carried between the bones through the interosseous
membrane. While the knife is between the bones,
its edge may be so turned that the membrane may be divided
longitudinally to any convenient extent for the easy introduction
of a retractor, and the soft parts around the bone
nearest to the operator may subsequently be divided by a
sweep of the knife in a manner similar to that adopted for
the division of parts around the more distant bone. The
sawing of the bones and dressing of the stump are accomplished
as in the thigh amputation; but more care is required
to avoid pressure on the acute margin of the tibia,
(which, when very sharp, should be removed,) and to prevent
the pendulous state of the flaps.</p>

<p>When the nature of the injury renders amputation necessary
at or immediately below the tuberosity of the tibia, the
operation may be done with safety. Baron Larrey recommended
the removal of the head of the fibula in such cases;
I have done it with impunity, and thereby made a better
stump than if it had not been done; but as the articulating
surface of the head of the fibula does sometimes enter into
the composition of the knee-joint, and as this cannot be
known beforehand, the removal of this portion of the fibula
is not advisable, neither must the tibia be sawn through
above the tuberosity lest the capsular ligament be implicated.
As an operation by which the knee-joint is saved,
it is important; for although the stump is very short, it
forms a solid support for the body, enables the patient to
walk without the aid of a stick, and admits of the adaptation
of an artificial leg. The skin, in these cases, must be saved
in every direction by flaps, to form a covering. When in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
sufficient quantity, the operation may be done by the circular
incision, as much muscle as possible being saved to aid in
forming a covering on the under and outer sides. The posterior
tibial artery will be found to have retracted behind
the head of the bone, whence it, or others which may bleed,
must be drawn out. The nerves should be cut as short as
possible.</p>

<h3 class="center">EXCISION OF THE ANKLE-JOINT.</h3>

<div class="figright illowp50" id="i-103" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-103.jpg" alt="Illustration of lower leg showing where to make an incision." />
</div>

<p>92. This operation should be performed in the following
manner: Begin the incision behind the external malleolus,
an inch and a half above its lower extremity, and carry it
downward and then forward
across the front of the ankle-joint,
then under the internal
malleolus and upward,
close behind this process, to
the extent of an inch and a
half; this incision should
merely divide the skin, and
should not, on any account,
wound the subjacent parts.
Raise the flap thus made,
and, placing the leg on its
inside, detach and turn
aside the peronei tendons
from the groove behind the
external malleolus. Cut
through the external lateral
ligaments of the ankle-joint,
keeping the knife close to the
end of the fibula; then, with the large bone-scissors or nippers,
cut through the fibula from one-half to three-quarters
of an inch above its junction with the tibia, and, after dividing
the ligamentous fibers connecting the two bones, remove
the malleolus externus. Turn the leg on to its outer side,
and cut through the internal lateral ligament close to the
tibia, to avoid wounding the posterior tibial artery; this
will allow the foot to be dislocated outward, and the lower
end of the tibia to be brought well out through the wound.
An assistant keeping the foot and tendons out of the way,
the lower end of the tibia is to be removed by a fine saw to
the same extent as the fibula, or as high as the injury or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
disease requires. The articulating surface, or injured part
of the astragalus, is then to be removed, after which the foot
is to be returned to its proper position, and the cut surfaces
of the tibia and astragalus brought into close approximation,
and so kept by suture, strapping, and bandage. The
limb is to be placed on an outside leg-splint, having a foot-piece
to it; and in order to prevent any matter oozing, an
opening should be maintained on the outside of the joint,
with a corresponding hole in the dressing and splint for this
purpose, until the recovery is completed. The shot-hole
will sometimes answer the purpose, when the injury is inflicted
by a musket-ball. There are no vessels to tie, unless
wounded accidentally.</p>

<h3 class="center">REMOVAL OF THE OS CALCIS.</h3>

<p>93. If this bone should be much shattered, and the injury
nearly confined to it alone, it may be removed in the following
manner: Make a semilunar incision down to the bone
from the posterior angle of the inner malleolus, across the
sole of the foot to the external malleolus, the convexity of
the flap being forward. This flap being turned back, the
tendo Achillis is brought into view, and is to be separated
from its attachment or cut across above it. The point of
junction between the calcis and astragalus having been ascertained,
the ligamentous fibers are to be cut through and
the joint between them opened, when the knife is to be carried
from behind forward, in order to divide the interosseous
ligament between them. Some ligamentous fibers passing
between the calcis and cuboid bones are then to be cut
through, when the os calcis may be dissected out without
difficulty. The posterior tibial artery and nerve will be
divided.</p>

<p>This bone was first removed for disease of its substance
by Mr. Hancock, and the operation has been done several
times since by Mr. Greenhow and others with success.</p>

<p>94. When the bones of the leg are not injured, although
those of the tarsus are so far destroyed as to render amputation
necessary, the operation introduced by Mr. Syme for
removing the foot at the ankle-joint will be well adapted for
this injury, provided the soft parts have not been so much
destroyed as to prevent the formation of the covering flap
or flaps. His directions are:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
“Pressure should be made on the tibial arteries by the
finger of an assistant or a tourniquet applied above the ankle.
The only instruments required are a knife, the blade of
which should not exceed four inches in length, and a saw.
The foot being held at a right angle to the leg, the point of
the knife is introduced immediately below the malleolar projection
of the fibula, rather nearer its posterior than anterior
edge, and then carried straight across the bone to the inner
side of the ankle, where it terminates at the point <i>exactly
opposite</i> its commencement. The extremities of the incision
thus formed are then joined by another passing in front of
the joint.</p>

</div>

<p>“The operator next proceeds to detach the flap from the
foot bone, and for this purpose, having placed the fingers of
his left hand over the prominence of the os calcis, and inserted
the point of his thumb between the edges of the
plantar incision, guides the knife between the bone and nail
of the thumb, taking great care to cut parallel with the bone
and to avoid scoring or laceration of the integuments. He
then opens the joint in front, carries his knife outward and
downward on each side of the astragalus so as to divide the
lateral ligaments, and thus completes the disarticulation.
Lastly, the knife is carried round the extremities of the tibia
and fibula so as to afford room for applying the saw, by
means of which the articular projections are removed, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
with the thin connecting slice of bone covered by
cartilage. The vessels being then tied, and the edges of
the wound stitched together, a piece of wet lint is applied
lightly over the stump, without any bandage, so as to avoid
the risk of undue pressure in the event of the cavity becoming
distended with blood, which would be apt to occasion
sloughing of the flap. When recovery is completed, the
stump has a bulbous form, from the thick cushion of dense
textures that cover the heel, and readily admits of being
fitted with a boot.</p>

<p>“The advantages which I originally anticipated from this
operation were&mdash;<i>first</i>, the formation of a more useful support
for the body than could be obtained from any form of
amputation of the leg; and, <i>secondly</i>, the diminution of
risk to the patient’s life, from the smaller amount of mutilation,
the cutting of arterial branches instead of trunks, the
leaving entire the medullary hollow and membrane, and the
exposure of cancellated bone, which is not liable to exfoliate
like the dense osseous substance of the shaft. From my own
experience, amounting to upwards of fifty cases, and that of
many other practitioners who have adopted amputation at
the ankle, I now feel warranted to state that these favorable
expectations have been fully realized, and that, in addition
to its other advantages, this operation may be regarded as
almost entirely free from danger to life.”</p>

<p>This operation has not answered, in some of the hospitals
in London, the expectations entertained of it from its success
in Edinburgh, the flap formed from the under part, or
heel, having frequently sloughed. This, Mr. Syme declares,
is the fault of the operators, and not of the operation, sufficient
attention not having been paid to make the flap of a
proper length, and no more, and to preserve the posterior
tibial artery intact, until it has divided into its plantar
branches. He insists, with reason, that the operation should
be done exactly as he has described it in the following explanation:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A transverse incision should be carried across the sole
of the foot, from the tip of the external malleolus, or a little
posterior to it, (rather nearer the posterior than the anterior
margin of the bone,) to the opposite point on the inner side,
which will be rather below the tip of the internal malleolus,
but can be readily determined by placing the thumb and
finger at opposite sides of the heel. If the incision be car<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>ried
farther forward, a considerable inconvenience is experienced
from the greater length of the flap; and I believe a
great deal of the difficulty that has been attributed to the
operation has arisen from this source&mdash;the operator getting
into the hollow of the os calcis, cuts and haggles, in striving
to clear the prominence of the bone, with the desperate energy
of an unfortunate mariner embayed on a lee shore in a
gale of wind. Another incision is then to be carried across
the instep, joining the ends of the former. The next point
to be attended to is, that in separating the flap of skin from
the os calcis you must cut parallel to the bone. This is
of the greatest importance, since when the flap is detached
from the bone, its only supply of nourishment must be the
branches which run through it parallel to the surface; and if,
instead of keeping parallel to the surface, you cut on the flap
as a butcher does when he skins a sheep&mdash;you will, by scoring
it in this way, necessarily cut across these branches. I
have reason to believe&mdash;nay, to know&mdash;that the sloughing
which has occurred in some cases has been due to these defects
in the performance of the operation; the flap having
been cut too long, difficulty has been experienced in separating
it from the calcaneum, and this has led to the scoring
of the flap, which has been inevitably followed by death of
a portion or the whole of it.”</p>

<p>Domestic surgery, or that of civil life, has in these operations
of excision of the ankle-joint, and of amputation at
that part, repaid her Amazonian sister of military warfare
for the improvements she has introduced into the great art
and science of surgery; and a degree of generous emulation
will be excited and maintained between them, which, it may
be hoped, will, during the present war in the East, add much
to its scientific and preservative character.</p>

<p>95. A musket-ball will seldom pass through the foot without
injuring a joint of some kind, or wounding a tendon or
nerve; and the injury to the fascia, which is very strong on
the sole of the foot, and frequently covered by much thickened
integument, is always attended with inconvenience.
The extraction of balls, of splinters of bone, of pieces of
cloth, and the discharge of matter become more difficult,
and often cause so much disease as ultimately to render amputation
of the foot necessary. Tetanus is a frequent consequence
of these injuries, and is a disease, in its <i>acute</i> form,
certainly irremediable by any operation or medicine at pres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>ent
known. Amputation has always failed in my hands,
although it was strongly recommended by Baron Larrey.
The operative surgery of the foot should be done as soon
after the injury as it can be conveniently accomplished; for
a large, clean, incised wound is a safe one, compared with a
torn surface of much less extent, and a splintered bone with
extraneous substances; as a ball lodged in the foot is always
very dangerous, great attention should be paid in the examination
of even slight wounds. A cannon-shot can seldom
strike the foot without destroying it altogether; it may, however,
strike the heel and destroy a considerable part of the
os calcis, without rendering amputation necessary, if the
ankle-joint be untouched; for by due attention in removing
the spicula of bone at first, and by making free openings for
the discharge of matter in every direction in which it may
appear inclined to insinuate itself, the limb may be preserved
in a useful state.</p>

<p>The following case, from the surgeon of the 44th Regiment,
in the Crimea, is an instance of the removal of the
foot after the manner recommended by the late M. Roux,
every effort having previously been made to save it: “Chloroform
having been administered, an incision was commenced
immediately in front of and below the internal malleolus;
this was carried downward and forward until it reached the
center of the sole of the foot. From the extremity of this
a second incision was made nearly at right angles, extending
backward along the sole and upward over the attachment
of the tendo Achillis to the os calcis. A third incision was
carried from this round and below the external malleolus to
meet the first at its commencement. Disarticulation of the
ankle-joint was made from the outside, the soft parts put
well on the stretch by forcibly depressing the foot, when, by
successive sweeps of the scalpel, care being taken to keep
the edge close to the bone, the os calcis was separated from
its connection with the soft parts. The plantar arteries were
divided at the very extremity of the flap. The operation
was completed by sawing off the two malleoli and the thin
scale of the articulating surface of the tibia. The anterior
tibial and the two plantar arteries each required a ligature.
Sutures were inserted, and the flap supported by strips of
wet lint. The operation was performed on the 4th of July.
The stump was dressed the second day after the operation.
There had been no hemorrhage; the flap was partially ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>herent;
on the outer side the skin was red, tense, and shining;
the sutures were very tight; they were removed from
this part; no appearance of sloughing.</p>

<p>“July 26th.&mdash;The ligatures came away upon the sixth
day; no sloughing of the flap occurred; a small abscess
formed both on the outside and inside of the leg, just where
the malleoli were sawn off. These were opened; the redness
of the skin rapidly disappeared after this. The line of incision
is now entirely healed at the outer part; the inner is
not so far advanced, but is doing well. The flap is becoming
a firm, round cushion; and the pressure, when he walks,
will fall upon the skin taken from the sole of the foot. The
advantages which this operation appears to possess are, that
the flap is not so large and baggy as in the early stage after
Syme’s amputation; it is performed with greater facility
and rapidity, and there is less chance of wounding the posterior
tibial artery.”</p>

<p>The accompanying sketch is of the astragalus and calcis
of the right foot, with a ball lodged on the inside, where it
joins the smaller apophysis of the os calcis. The round spot
(No. 3) represents the ball, and the tendons of the anterior
tibial and of the common flexor muscles of the toes must
have been divided by it; the proper flexor of the great toe
is at some little distance below, and unhurt; the posterior
tibial nerve and the artery, about to divide into the two
plantars, are still farther distant. In this case the ball might
and ought to have been removed by the gouge, the small
chisel, the screw, or other instrument supplied for this purpose,
as soon as possible after the injury. Nothing was
done, however; inflammation and ulceration extended into
the ankle-joint, and the amputation of the foot by the flap
operation at the joint was performed and failed. The leg
became affected; and the case ended in amputation of the
thigh, from which the man recovered, and was sent to England.
I know not his name, nor the regiment he belonged
to, nor the surgeon who attended him, nor any more of the
case, as the bone only has been sent to me from Scutari as
a personal attention.</p>

<p>If the ball had entered to a greater depth, the proper
operation would have been to remove the bone altogether,
which is a difficult and disagreeable operation, even when
done in cases in which this bone has been dislocated, and is
projecting under the skin. It is much more so when in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
proper place; less so when the ends of the tibia and fibula
are also removed for disease of these parts, in which case,
the bone being softened, it yields readily to the scissors, by
which it should be divided, and to which it opposes, when
sound, a great resistance from its solidity. The removal of
the astragalus alone has been successfully performed for disease
in children, in two instances, by Mr. Statham, of University
College Hospital, and has been strongly recommended
by Dr. Buchanan, of Glasgow, and others. The operation,
according to Mr. Statham’s method, is to be done as follows:
An incision, four and a half inches long, is to be commenced
within the anterior edge of the fibula, and carried down in a
straight line beyond the anterior end of the metatarsal bone
of the little toe; a second incision, about an inch in length,
should then be made from the center of the wound downward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
toward the sole of the foot, for the purpose of giving room.
The integuments are then to be raised from the bone, from
the upper edge of the first incision, carrying with them the
extensor tendons toward the inside of the
foot, to give more room for ulterior proceedings,
without injuring them. The under
joint of a pair of short, strong scissors,
such as are supplied in the capital cases of
instruments, ought then to be pushed under
the neck of the astragalus, at the hollow,
where it is attached by a strong interosseous
ligament to the os calcis. The
upper blade being then closed upon the
bone, it may be divided, but not without
considerable force. The articulating end
of the astragalus with the os naviculare
can then be easily removed by a strong
pair of forceps, its ligamentous attachments
being first divided by the knife. In
order to extract the remaining portion of
bone, the under blade of the strong scissors
must be again pushed under it from before
backward, and made to cut it in two. The
outer part being now separated from the
internal end of the fibula, care being taken
not to injure the perpendicular ligament
going from that bone to the os calcis, this
piece should be forcibly removed by strong
forceps&mdash;an operation which could not be
easily borne unless chloroform were used.
The remaining piece or pieces must follow,
when an examination should be made by
the finger to ascertain that none remain.
The parts should be brought together, a
little lint and cold water applied, the limb
placed on a splint, and interfered with afterward
as little as possible. The wood-cut
represents the forceps for extracting a ball
imbedded in the astragalus.</p>

<p>Many years have elapsed since I stated that muscles might
be cut across without, or with very little, inconvenience resulting
from their division. Mr. Stanley has lately shown
that tendons even may be cut across with little disability
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
following, in a boy who had suffered an injury to the wrist;
inflammation followed, with disease of the bones; and Mr.
Stanley, instead of amputating the hand, made a flap on the
back of it through the tendons. He removed seven of the
small bones&mdash;all, indeed, except the trapezium supporting
the thumb. The tendons reunited, and the boy has a remarkably
good motion of the hand and fingers&mdash;proving the
propriety of an operation which does so much credit to Mr.
Stanley.</p>

<p>The astragalus may be also removed by a similar flap operation
dividing the extensor tendons of the toes, commencing
on the outside of the fibula, and being carried round
in front, but not so far as to injure the tibialis anticus tendon,
nor the anterior tibial artery and nerve; or, when the
incision reaches the edge of the outer extensor, the whole
of them are to be separated from the parts beneath, and
drawn inward, when the operation of removing the bone is
to be completed, as in the former instance. But many surgeons
believe that when tendons are forcibly drawn aside,
after being separated from their attachments, they are apt
to slough, and that their division would, in most cases, be
less injurious. In neither operation need tendon, artery,
vein, or nerve of any importance be divided.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be stated that less regard is paid generally
to gunshot wounds of the foot in which balls lodge than
is desirable; and that other methods of operating may be
devised for removing the astragalus less difficult in their
performance, and more advantageous for the sufferers. The
other bones of the instep and foot should be treated in a
similar manner when balls lodge in them. Their removal
may be more readily effected.</p>

<p>96. Wounds from cannon-shot injuring the fore part of
the foot are better remedied by amputation at the joints of
the tarsus with the metatarsus, than by sawing these bones
across; but when the injury affects only one or two toes,
they may be removed separately, recollecting that it is of
greater importance to preserve the great toe than any other,
and that this toe is worth preserving alone, when any one
of the others would be rather troublesome than useful.
Musket-balls seldom commit so much injury as to require
amputation as a primary operation, although they may frequently
render it necessary as a secondary one. The splinters
of bone are to be removed, the ball and extraneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
substances are, if possible, to be taken out; and if the bones,
tendons, and blood-vessels are so much injured as to render
the attempt to preserve them useless, amputation is to be
performed. If the preservation of the limb be thought
practicable&mdash;and it generally will be so in wounds from
musket-balls&mdash;the attempt must be made under the most
rigid antiphlogistic treatment, the local application of leeches
and cold water from the first, with free openings for the
subsequent discharge. Musket-balls seldom injure the metatarsal
bones so as to require their removal with their toes,
and under the treatment above mentioned these wounds will
in general be healed without further operation. Wounds
from grape-shot occasionally render the removal of the metatarsal
bone of the great toe at the tarsus necessary, although
much should be done to save it. The little and
adjacent toes are also sometimes removed at the tarsus, the
middle ones but seldom, as it is not an easy operation to
perform, in consequence of the naturally close attachment of
these bones, and the additional compactness they have acquired
from the pressure of the shoe. Hemorrhage from
the arteries of the foot authorizes amputation in a very
slight degree, even when superadded to other causes; for
the incisions necessary to secure the bleeding vessels will
not, in general, add much to the original injury, unless they
be very extensive; while, on the contrary, they render the
wound less complicated and more manageable.</p>

<p>97. Amputation at the tarsus, when it is proposed to save
the flap from the under part of the foot, is performed in the
following manner: The joints of the metatarsus with the
tarsus having been well ascertained, an incision is to be made
across the foot, in the direction of the joints, but from half
to three-quarters of an inch nearer the toes, and the integuments
drawn back over the tarsus. From the extremities
of this incision, two others are to be made along the sides
of the great and little toes, for about two inches and a half,
according to the thickness of the foot; the ends of these
two incisions are to be united by a transverse one down to
the bone, on the sole of the foot, the corners being rounded
off. The flap thus formed on the under part is to be dissected
back from the metatarsal bones, including as much of
the muscular parts as possible, as far as the under part of
the joints of the tarsus. The metatarsal bones are now to
be removed by cutting into and dislocating each joint from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the side, commencing on the outside, by placing the edge of
the knife immediately above, but close to the projection made
by the posterior part of the metatarsal bone supporting the
little toe, which prominence is always readily perceived.
The arteries are to be secured, any long tendons and loose
capsular ligament to be removed with the knife or scissors,
and the under flap, formed from the sole of the foot, is to be
raised up so as to make a neat stump when brought in contact
with the upper portion of integuments that was first
turned back; the whole to be retained in this position by
sutures, adhesive plaster, and bandage. When the skin of
the under part of the foot is much torn, which is not uncommon
in a wound made by a fragment of a shell, the flap
cannot be formed from it; in this case it must in a great
measure be saved from the upper part; but the integuments
being here so much thinner, the flap is not so good a defense
against external violence, and will be more readily affected
by cold. The metatarsal bones may be sawn across in a
straight line, in preference to removing them at the joint;
and although the whole may be sawn across at once with
more ease than any one of them individually, except the
outer ones, yet the stump is never so much protected from
external violence as when the operation is performed at the
joints of the tarsus.</p>

<p>98. Amputation of the foot, leaving the astragalus and
calcis, may, in certain cases of injury anterior to these bones,
be performed with advantage, care being taken to make the
under flap so large that the line of cicatrization may be on
the upper and anterior edge of the stump, rather than transversely
across the face of it, in order to render it firmer, and
better able to resist and sustain any pressure which may be
applied to it.</p>

<p>The limb being placed on the table, and held by an assistant,
the surgeon ascertains the situation of the joint formed
by the junction of the astragalus with the scaphoides, which
will be indicated by the prominence on the inside of the
tarsus, discoverable by passing the finger forward from the
malleolus internus toward the side of the great toe. The
joint of the os cuboides with the os calcis on the outside is
always to be found about half an inch behind the projection
formed by the posterior part of the metatarsal bone of the
little toe. The under part of the foot being firmly held in
the palm of the surgeon’s hand, he places the point of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
thumb on the external joint, and that of the forefinger over
the internal one; these indicate a transverse oblique line for
the first incision, which should commence near the thumb,
and be continued with a semilunar sweep, the convexity toward
the toes, until it terminates at the side of the foot where
the forefinger was placed. The joint between the astragalus
and scaphoides is now to be opened, by directing the knife
from within obliquely outward toward the projection of the
metatarsal bone of the little toe. These bones are then to
be dislocated by pressure, and the ligaments retaining them
divided. The joint between the os cuboides and the os calcis
is next to be opened from without inward, and the bones
dislocated. The strong inter-articular ligament being cut,
and the joint largely opened, the knife is to be passed between
the under surfaces of the scaphoides and cuboides,
and the soft parts adhering to them, and a flap cut from behind
forward sufficiently large to cover the wound, which is
then to be dressed in the usual manner.</p>

<p>99. Mr. Wakley, jun., has lately performed a successful
operation for the removal of the astragalus and calcis, deserving
of imitation in peculiar cases. It is done as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The patient being under chloroform, the diseased foot
(the left) having been drawn forward, so as to be free from
the table, an incision was made from malleolus to malleolus,
directly across the heel. A second incision was next carried
along the edge of the sole, from the middle of the first to a
point opposite the astragalo-scaphoid articulation, and another
on the opposite side of the foot, from the vertical incision
to the situation of the calcaneo-cuboid joint. These
latter incisions enabled the operator to make a flap about
two inches in length from the integument of the sole. In
the next place a circular flap of integument was formed between
the two malleoli posteriorly, the lower border of the
flap reaching to the insertion of the tendo Achillis. This
flap being turned upward, the tendon was cut through, and
the os calcis, having been disarticulated from the astragalus
and cuboid bones, was removed, together with the integument
of the heel included between the two incisions. The
lateral ligaments connecting the astragalus with the tibia
and fibula were next divided, and the knife was carried into
the joint on each side, extreme care being observed to avoid
wounding the anterior tibial artery, which was in view. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
astragalus was then detached from the soft parts in front of
the joint and from its articulation with the scaphoid bone,
and the malleoli were removed with the bone-nippers. The
only artery requiring ligature was the posterior tibial. Dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>ing
the few minutes the operation lasted, the patient did not
manifest the slightest symptoms of pain or uneasiness. On
bringing the edges of the flaps together, they were found to
fit with accuracy, and were secured by twelve interrupted
sutures. The wounds were covered by several folds of lint,
and supported by a light bandage. The patient, who had
lost but very little blood, was then removed to his bed.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>These drawings exhibit the present condition of both sides of the foot&mdash;the
amount of deformity is less than might have been expected.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“On the 21st of February he was discharged the hospital,
exactly two months after the operation, to go into the country,
the foot being well, with the exception of a small open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>ing.
He came again up to town on the 15th of April, and
has become stout. The sinus on the left side of the foot
had closed, but a slight collection of matter had formed a
little above the instep; this was discharged by means of a
puncture with the lancet, and he was directed to return to
the country, and dash cold water over the foot two or three
times daily. On the 10th of June he returned to town to
his employment. There was then not the vestige of a wound,
the last opening having completely closed. He was ordered
to wear a high-heeled boot. He is now a healthy-looking
man, and walks very well.”</p>

<p>As the posterior tibial must be divided, the preservation
of the anterior artery is essentially necessary; the success
of the operation depends upon it. This artery, accompanied
by its vein and nerve, lies close upon the astragalus;
the artery may be said to be even attached to it, a point
requiring the greatest attention in dissecting out the bone
without injuring this vessel, which is seen under the scalpel.</p>

<p>100. Amputation of a single metatarsal bone, on the outside
or inside of the foot, is to be done by an incision round
the root of the toe, terminating in a line on the outside of
the foot, which is continued down to the joint of the tarsus.
The integuments are turned back above and below from the
metatarsal bone, which is to be dissected out, with the toe
attached to it, and the flaps brought together so as to leave
but one line of incision. In military surgery, there is always
a wound; and when the removal of the bone is necessary,
it is in general an extensive one, with loss of substance, so
that a covering cannot be saved in this way, especially on
the upper part of the foot, when struck by a ball or piece of
shell. The surgeon, therefore, must be prepared to look for
his covering on the under part, where he will occasionally
not be able to procure it in sufficient quantity, and it must
not be forgotten that the neighboring parts will often be
injured. The object must then be to save the integuments
from such parts as are uninjured, so as to cover in the wound
as nearly as possible when the bone has been removed. In
doing this, the first incision should commence at the upper
part and inside of the toe, and be carried round so as to
separate the toe from its attachment to its fellow. If the
injury be entirely on the upper part, the continuation of this
incision must be so regulated as to form the whole of the
flap from below, and its commencement above must be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>tinued
round the injured part so as to meet the lower end
near the articulation of the bone with the tarsus, and <i>vice
versa</i>. If the ball have gone directly through, destroying
the integuments above and below, the incisions must surround
the injured part in such a manner, on the upper and
under side of the foot, as to allow the flaps to be formed in
every other part, except where the injury was inflicted, from
which granulations must arise. By saving skin everywhere
else, the wound will be much diminished in size, will heal
sooner, will be less liable to suffer from external violence and
less obnoxious to the subsequent pain which generally at
intervals attends wounds of this kind.</p>

<p>101. M. de Beaufoy has invented a foot for the wooden
pin used by the soldiers in the Invalides, at Paris, who had
suffered amputation above or below the knee; this, Mr. Bigg,
of Leicester Square, has tried on some old soldiers at Chelsea
Hospital; one of them reports that he has not only found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
his step to be steadier, but that he could walk twice the distance
in the same time that he could with his ordinary pin-leg.</p>

<p>The advantage of the invention is, that whereas a common
wooden pin only gives one point of support, and consequently
the body is obliged to raise itself so as to describe
an arc, of which the end of the wooden pin is the center, the
curved foot acts like a <i>series of levers</i>, each successive point
of it being a <i>fulcrum</i>. The precaution should be taken to
have the aperture at <i>a</i>, fig. 2, for the insertion of the pin,
made square, to prevent its turning when in use.</p>

<p class="h2sub">PRIMARY AMPUTATION, ETC.</p>

<p>102. An upper extremity should not be amputated for
almost any accident which can happen to it from musket-shot;
and there is scarcely an injury of the soft parts
likely to occur which would authorize amputation as a primary
operation.</p>

<p>103. If the head or articulating extremity of the bone
entering into the composition of the shoulder-joint be merely
or slightly injured by musket-shot, the arm ought to be saved
with some defect of motion in the joint. The wound should
be enlarged in the first instance, to allow of a sufficient examination
with the point of the finger, and any loose pieces
of bone should be removed. Inflammation is to be restrained
within due bounds until suppuration has been established,
when, if a clear depending opening should not exist for the
discharge of the matter poured out, it should be made, and
any loose portions of bone removed. The principal points
to attend to are, the prevention of sinuses around the joint,
by the formation of dependent openings, position, perfect
quietude, due support, the methodical application of bandages,
and occasional mild stimulating injections into the
wound. A simple incised wound penetrating the joint, and
even injuring the bone, does not call for any immediate operation.
An attempt should be made to effect a cure by
the first intention, which can only be managed by means of
proper position and support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
104. If the head of the bone be much splintered, or if a
ball have gone through it, that portion should be sawn off;
for a part thus injured has often been a source of great inconvenience
and suffering for many years afterward&mdash;during,
in fact, the remainder of the life of the sufferer; which misery
would have been avoided by the excision of the head of
the bone in the first instance&mdash;an operation which ought in
fact to be done even at a later period, if it had not been
performed at the time when the injury was received. Secondary
operations of this kind are never so successful as
primary ones, and great discrimination should be exercised
in attempting to save the head of the bone, or, in other
words, to avoid the operation for its removal.</p>

<p>105. When the splinters extend far into the shaft of the
humerus, it may be proper to amputate the whole extremity,
especially if the great artery be also wounded; but the shaft
is seldom broken in such accidents to any great extent, and
amputation should be confined almost to injuries from cannon-shot
or shells, or heavy machinery, destructive of the
soft parts as well as of the bone.</p>

<p>106. When the injury done to the upper arm is so extensive
that it cannot be saved, although the head of the humerus
be not injured, the amputation should take place
immediately below the tuberosities, and not at the joint,
which latter operation always renders the shoulder flatter,
and the appearance of the person more unseemly, than when
the head of the bone is left in its place.</p>

<p>107. It will frequently happen that the arm may be irrecoverably
shattered, and the thorax partake in a less degree
of the injury, there being apparent only some slight contusion
or grazing of the skin; if low down, the elasticity of
the false ribs may have prevented the integuments being
much injured in appearance, although the blow has been
violent; yet the force of the large shot may have ruptured
the liver or spleen. If higher up, it may perhaps fracture
the ribs, in addition to a more severe contusion of the integuments.
When these accidents occur, the symptoms arising
from the wound or contusion of the trunk of the body are
to be first considered. If they do not indicate a speedy dissolution
of the patient, or the prospect of such an event in
two or three days, the operation ought to be performed, and
a chance of recovery given to the sufferer, which he would
not have, the arm being retained, and the injury of the chest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
remaining the same. The danger to be apprehended in the
more favorable cases is from inflammation, and this will be
rather diminished than increased by the operation; the danger
of deferring which is manifest and certain, while the
injury committed in the thorax or abdomen is not ascertained,
and its effects may be obviated. If the termination should
be unfavorable, it can only be a matter of regret for the sake
of the individual, and not for the non-performance of a duty.
If the cavity of the chest be laid open, or several ribs beaten
in, or a stuffing of the lungs take place from a large ruptured
blood-vessel&mdash;all of which circumstances are obvious, and
cannot be mistaken&mdash;the operation would, in all probability,
be useless. A hemorrhage of short duration, or the expectoration
of blood in moderate quantities, although a dangerous
symptom, is not to be considered as depriving the patient
of a reasonable chance for life, for it frequently follows blows
from more common causes, from which many people recover.
If the operation be delayed to ascertain what injury may
have been done to the chest, from the symptoms that will
follow, the danger resulting from both will be increased;
and even when it has been ascertained that there is but little
mischief existing in the thorax, the operation can no longer
be performed with the same propriety, in consequence of the
inflammation which has supervened; and the patient will
probably die, when he would have recovered under a more
decided mode of treatment.</p>

<p>108. A round shot or flat piece of shell may strike the
arm, after rebounding from the ground, or when nearly exhausted
in force, without breaking the skin, or only slightly
doing it, yet all the parts within may be so much injured as
not to be able to recover themselves: the bone may be considerably
broken or splintered, the muscles and nerves greatly
contused. The injury may not, perhaps, be quite so extensive.
The bone may be merely fractured, and yet the soft
parts will often be so much destroyed as not to be able to
carry on their usual actions. A ruptured blood-vessel may,
with an apparently slight external wound of this nature,
pour out its blood between the muscles, and inject the arm
to nearly double its size, all of which are causes rendering an
operation necessary, and requiring decision, for inflammation
will, and mortification may, ensue in a short time, when the
most favorable moment for operation will have been lost.</p>

<p>109. <i>Amputation at the shoulder-joint</i> is an operation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
little surgical importance. The fear formerly entertained of
loss of blood has passed away, and every surgeon now knows
that if he should happen to cut the axillary artery unintentionally,
it can be held between the forefinger and thumb,
without difficulty or danger, until a ligature can be placed
upon it. No accomplished surgeon of the present day
should give himself the least concern about compressing the
subclavian artery. It is, on the contrary, better, when the
arm is raised from the side preparatory to entering or using
the knife, that the surgeon should then feel the pulsation of
the artery in the axilla, that he may the more easily avoid,
and subsequently command it. The axillary artery does not
throw out much blood at each pulsation, and a little pressure
with the end of the forefinger will always prevent bleeding,
until the surgeon is prepared to take hold of the vessel with
the tenaculum or forceps. The operator should, in fact, divest
himself of all fear of hemorrhage. When gentlemen
are afraid, however, and cannot help it, (for Henry IV. of
France, <i>ce roy si vaillant</i>, always felt an inconvenient intestinal
motion when a fight began,) compression may be made
upon the subclavian artery by the thumb of an assistant, the
round handle of a key, or the padded end of the handle of
a tourniquet; the latter forms the best pad, and is usually
at hand.</p>

<p>110. The great point to be attended to in performing the
operation is to save skin to cover the stump. The directions,
therefore, which are usually given for doing it after
any particular method can only be occasionally useful; for
the surgeon may not always be able to select the parts to
be divided or retained. In cases of malignant disease of
the bone and periosteum of the middle of the arm, my experience
directs the removal of the whole of the bone at
the joint, and not the amputation below the head; although
the appearance of the integuments, and of the bone itself,
would seem to encourage the attempt to preserve the roundness
of the shoulder. In such cases, the removal of the extremity
at the joint may be done by any one of the many
ways which have been recommended for its performance.
In none should the acromion or coracoid process be exposed,
unless previously injured. Neither is it necessary to lose
time, or to give pain, by depriving the glenoid cavity of its
cartilage; but it should always be borne in mind that if
the nerves be not shortened after the removal of the arm,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
they may be included in or adhere to the cicatrix, and cause,
during a long life, much distressing pain to the sufferer.</p>

<p>111. Amputation at the shoulder-joint, performed immediately
after the receipt of an injury, is now a very simple
operation, for which simplicity English surgery is also indebted
to the Peninsular war. As a <i>secondary</i> operation,
or done at a later period, when the parts are all impacted
together, it is less so. In both stages it is absolutely necessary
to remember&mdash;1st. That, except in cases of disease, and
not of injury, the shaft of the bone must be broken; and
that <i>all</i> the directions usually given for rotation of the arm
inward and outward during the operation are <i>unnecessary
cruelties</i> not to be attempted, and rarely to be effected if
attempted, with a broken bone. 2d. That the arm should
always be raised from the side and supported by the hand
of an assistant, who can feel, if he please, at any time of the
operation, the pulsation of the axillary artery; and all operative
methods are hereby condemned in which this precautionary
measure is not the first step.</p>

<p>112. <i>Operation by two flaps, external and internal.</i>&mdash;The
outer&mdash;beginning nearly an inch below the acromion
process, the hair in the axilla having been previously removed&mdash;is
to be carried down with a gentle curve so deeply
as to divide the deltoid muscle, and to show the long head
of the triceps at its under and outer edge. The second incision
is to be carried in a similar direction on the inside,
through the deltoid muscle, but need not divide the insertion
of the pectoralis major, which should be exposed. These
flaps being held back, the joint will be seen and readily
opened into at its upper part, by cutting upon the head
of the bone, in doing which the long tendon of the biceps
will be divided, allowing the head of the humerus to drop
from the glenoid cavity sufficiently to admit the forefinger
of the left hand, on which the supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus,
and teres minor may be cut through externally, as they go
to be inserted into the great tuberosity, and the thick tendon
of the sub-scapularis muscle internally, where it is attached
to the smaller tuberosity. The head of the bone is
then readily drawn out from the glenoid cavity, when the
inner flap, including the axillary artery, vein, and nerves,
may be taken hold of between the two forefingers and thumb
of an assistant, while the surgeon, with one sweep of the
knife, divides all the remaining parts below. The axillary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and the posterior circumflex arteries will have to be secured;
the anterior circumflex, when arising from the posterior, is
frequently cut off with it; the nerves are to be shortened;
the flaps brought together by sutures; and an especial pad
placed upon the pectoralis major, to prevent unnecessary
retraction, if possible.</p>

<p>113. <i>The operation by one</i>, or nearly one upper flap, is
to be performed when the under soft parts of the arm have
been destroyed, and the bone broken. It may be done by
thrusting a small, two-edged knife through the integuments
and under the deltoid muscle, from side to side, to form a
flap; or it may be made by commencing an incision an inch
above the posterior fold of the armpit, and carrying it over
the arm in a curved form, the convexity being downward, to
the same height on the anterior fold; the lowest part of the
incision being five fingers’ breadth from the point of the
acromion, the posterior end or point of it being somewhat
higher than the anterior one. The flap being turned up,
and the tendon of the pectoralis major divided, the head of
the bone is to be exposed and separated as before stated, as
much as possible of the integuments being preserved on the
under part of the arm. This will often be best done by
dissecting out the head and broken pieces of bone, and then
preserving in succession every piece of sound integument,
before the artery, vein, and nerves are divided.</p>

<p>114. Lisfranc and many French and continental surgeons
recommend the operation to be done with a pointed, double-edged
knife, in the following manner: The arm being approximated
to the trunk, in a state of half pronation, the
point of the knife is to be entered at a small triangular
space, which may be perceived on the inside of the fullness
of the shoulder, bounded above by the scapular extremity of
the clavicle and a small part of the acromion; on the inside,
by the coracoid process; and on the outside, by the head of
the humerus. The knife thus entered obliquely is to be
passed across to the outside, opening in its passage into the
joint, when, by sliding the knife forward over the head of
the bone, while the deltoid is raised up by the operator or
an assistant, a flap is to be formed, during which proceeding
the arm is to be raised from the side, to facilitate its performance.
If this flap be well made, the upper part of the
capsular ligament, the tendons of the long head of the biceps,
and the supra-spinatus are divided, and the tendons of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
infra-spinatus, teres minor, and sub-scapularis are also cut
through in part, if not entirely. The upper and posterior
flap is thus completed.</p>

<p>In the second step of the operation, the surgeon passes
the knife behind the head of the humerus, and makes the
under and anterior or inner flap, by cutting downward and
inward, including in it a very small portion of the deltoid,
the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, teres major, the triceps,
coraco-brachialis, the short head of the biceps, and
the vessels and nerves, when the limb is separated from the
body. The flaps are nearly of the same size, and are to be
brought together by sutures.</p>

<p>In the secondary operation, or that done several weeks
after the receipt of the injury, in consequence of the attempt
to save the arm having failed, it should be borne in mind
that the soft parts will often be found so altered and impacted
together that they will not yield or separate; and
nothing is gained but by each cut of the knife, causing
thereby some little delay, inconvenience, and loss of time.</p>

<p>115. <i>Amputation of the arm immediately below the tuberosities
of the humerus</i> ought to be done in the following
manner: The arm being raised from the side, and an assistant
having compressed, or being ready to compress, the subclavian
artery, the surgeon commences his incision one or
two fingers’ breadth beneath the acromion process, and carries
it to the inside of the arm, below the edge of the
pectoral muscle, then under the arm to the outside, where it
is to be met by another incision, begun at the same spot as
the first, below the acromion process. The integuments,
thus divided, are to be retracted, and the muscular parts
cut through, until the bone is cleared as high as the tuberosities.
The artery will be seen at the under part, and
should be pulled out by a tenaculum or spring forceps, and
secured as soon as divided. The bone is best sawn, the
surgeon standing on the outside; the nerves should be cut
short, and the flaps brought together by two or three silk
or leaden sutures. There are few or no other vessels to
tie, and the cure is completed in the usual time, while the
rotundity of the shoulder is preserved. This operation is
similar to that already recommended for the amputation at
the joint, which in many cases it is intended to supersede.</p>

<p>116. <i>Excision of the head of the humerus.</i>&mdash;The point
governing the modus operandi of this operation is, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
ought to be, the fact that, under the most favorable state
of recovery which can take place, the shoulder-joint usually
becomes so stiff that its ordinary motions may be considered
to be lost. Operative processes which have for their principal
object the sparing of the deltoid muscle are unnecessary,
for, if spared, it is as useless as if it had been cut; and
it seems to have been forgotten that, when cut, it reunites,
and becomes nearly as strong as before it was injured. It
is the joint that cannot be moved, not the muscle which has
lost its power. I prefer, therefore, in doing this operation,
in cases of some standing, to make a <i>short</i> crescentic flap
by an incision across the anterior part of the shoulder, as
in the operation of amputation, which, on being turned up,
leaves the joint exposed. The edge of the knife being applied
to the head of the bone in a line below, but immediately
under the acromion process, divides the capsular
ligament, and with it the long tendon of the biceps, on
which the arm drops from the socket, or glenoid cavity, and
allows the finger to be introduced, when the three muscles
inserted into the great tuberosity may be cut through, and
the sub-scapularis inserted into the small tuberosity will also
be divided. The head of the bone is then readily brought
out, and may be easily detached from any surrounding connections,
and sawn off with little or almost no loss of blood.
The elbow is to be supported, so as to bring the end of the
sawn bone in apposition with the glenoid cavity. The flap
may be allowed to unite with the parts below as soon as it
will, the shot-holes, if any, being in general sufficient to allow
of such discharge as may be necessary.</p>

<p>In cases of <i>recent</i> injury, considerable aid will be obtained
in keeping the sawn end of the humerus in apposition with
the glenoid cavity, by not dividing the long tendon of the
biceps. This must be done by dissecting it out of its groove
in the humerus, between the tuberosities, and by cutting
through the capsular ligament vertically, so as to follow it
up to its attachment to the upper edge of the glenoid cavity,
when it may be easily drawn aside with a blunt hook, until
the operation has been completed&mdash;a proceeding difficult of
accomplishment in old cases of disease or injury, and in them
not necessary nor advisable.</p>

<p>The accompanying sketch shows the head of the humerus
of the right arm or side, with a ball lodged in it, a relic from
Inkerman, sent to me as an especial mark of attention by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
one of the medical officers at Scutari, but without the name
of the man, the regiment he belonged to, or the surgeon who
performed the operation for its removal. The following
account was wrapped round the bone. It commences a day
or two after the operation was done at Scutari, and shows
that the man died from an affection of the lungs, not uncommon,
as was first shown during the late war, after operations
following extensive suppurations:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Pulse soft, 120. He passed a rather restless night,
although he had another opiate at one <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and partially
removed the dressings. In the morning he was better; he
took some tea and a little wine with arrow-root, but was very
much depressed in spirits. The wound looked well, there
being less discharge, and of a more healthy character; no
increased inflammation around the wound, but no tendency
to union by the first intention on removal of the stitches.
He was put upon farinaceous diet, with four ounces of wine
and beef-tea. He continued to do well till the evening of
the 16th, when he complained of tightness of the chest and
slight cough. Harshness of respiratory murmur and increased
vocal resonance, but no crepitation, could be detected
on the right side on auscultation; he complained also of pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
in the hypogastrium and slight diarrhœa. At bedtime he
had a sedative antimonial draught, after which he rested
well, but perspired profusely. On being particularly questioned,
he admitted that he had had diarrhœa several times
since landing at Varna, and had had bloody stools after the
battle of Alma, for which, however, he had never been off
duty; he had also frequently been troubled with cough, and
two of his family, he understood, died of consumption. For
two days he continued to improve in spirits, to take his food
better, and the wound assumed a healthy granulating appearance,
but a very small portion of the end of the humerus
appeared white, as if going to necrose. On the evening of
the 18th his breathing was more oppressed, and his countenance
flushed and anxious. On examination of the chest,
the lower two-thirds of the right lung were dull on percussion;
bronchial breathing in the lower half, with crepitation
above; in the left lung loud sub-crepitus; diarrhœa had also
supervened during the day, but was checked for the time by
an opiate enema. From this date his strength gradually
sank; the diarrhœa returned again and again, in spite of
repeated opiate enemata and small doses of Dover’s powder
with hyd. c. cretâ. The surface of the wound assumed a less
healthy appearance; the respiration became more labored,
and he gradually sank till Saturday, November the 25th,
when he died at half-past ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>“On examination of the head of the bone, after its removal,
there was found an irregular, rugged cavity in the
cancellated tissue, about an inch long, by half an inch broad,
extending nearly transversely from the smaller to the greater
tuberosity, and above the latter a musket-ball was found
deeply imbedded, its external convex surface being on a
level with the articular cartilage. From this several small
fissures radiated over the globular head, and from each end
of the cavity a much deeper one extended round the anatomical
neck, separating the articular portion of the bone,
in two-thirds of its circumference, from the shaft.</p>

<p>“At the post-mortem examination, the surface of the
wound looked black and sloughy near the seat of injury,
but more healthy in the direction of the incisions. A small
portion of the end of the humerus was of a pearly white, in
progress of necrosing; but around the shaft, immediately
below this, and in the glenoid cavity, the process of repair
had commenced. Both lungs were found engorged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
frothy serum; the lower two-thirds of the right lung hepatized;
traces of old tubercle in apices of both lungs, with
miliary tubercle scattered throughout the whole substance
of the left and upper part of the right. The whole tract of
the colon, from the cæcum to the rectum, presented traces
of ulceration, the ulcers being seldom larger than a split pea,
with hardened, elevated edges; the bases in some instances
were formed by the peritoneum only; generally they were
scattered irregularly, but occasionally they were found in
rows corresponding to the long diameter of the gut. In
the rectum the ulceration was more extensive, in some parts
the size of a farthing, the edges very irregular, and the direction
more transverse.” These appearances precisely resemble
those observed during the autopsy in cases of death from
consumption, and are not therefore peculiar to the dysentery
under which he had suffered.”</p>

<p>117. Professor B. Langenbeck, in order to save the deltoid
muscle, proposed and practiced the operation in the
following manner, during the Danish war in Sleswick-Holstein,
with success in several instances: Begin the incision
through the integuments and deltoid muscle immediately
below the anterior border of the acromion, and continue it
directly downward, over the minor tuberosity of the humerus,
to the extent of four inches. Separate the parts, open the
sheath of the long tendon of the biceps muscle, and draw
out and hold it on one side with a blunt hook. Rotate the
arm outward, (<i>if it will rotate</i>,) to facilitate the division of
the tendon of the sub-scapularis; then rotate the arm inward,
to aid in the division of the tendons of the supra-spinatus,
infra-spinatus, and teres minor muscles, inserted into the great
tuberosity. Complete the division of the capsular ligament,
push the bone through from below, using the arm as a lever
if you can, and saw it off. No arteries of consequence are
wounded.</p>

<p>This operation would not be so easy of execution as is
supposed, in cases in which the head and neck of the humerus
are broken from the shaft; it would be very difficult of
execution in old cases in which the soft parts are so hardened
and impacted as to admit of little or no motion.</p>

<p>The extent to which the shaft of the humerus may be
removed with the head cannot be distinctly defined. The
greater the distance, the less will be the chance of the bone
uniting to the glenoid cavity, in such a manner as to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
it a useful limb, whether by the formation of a ginglymoid
joint, or by anchylosis. In the present state of our knowledge
the bone should not be sawn lower than the insertion
of the deltoid muscle. If the arm were preserved by an
operation below that part, it is probable that the bone, however
supported, would not become attached to the glenoid
cavity. It might however become useful, by some artificial
help, as has occurred in cases of false joint in the middle
arm, after ununited fractures.</p>

<p>118. Excision of the head of the humerus is not to be
done in every instance of compound fracture of that bone,
as the following cases will show:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Madden, 52d Regiment, was wounded at the
assault of Badajos in 1812, by a musket-ball, which fractured
the head of the humerus, and lodged in it. The
broken pieces were from time to time removed by incisions,
together with the ball, and he ultimately preserved a very
serviceable arm. He is now a very zealous member of the
Church of England.</p>

<p>Robert Masters, 40th Regiment, was wounded at the battle
of Toulouse, on the 12th of April, 1814, by a musket-ball
in the right shoulder, which lodged in the head of the
bone. Shown to me a few days afterward as a case for
amputation at the shoulder-joint, I directed the excision of
the head of the bone as soon as the parts became more
quiescent. Under venesection, purgatives, leeches, the constant
application of cold, and low diet, the high inflammatory
symptoms which had supervened subsided, and, six
weeks after the accident, the ball, and part of the head of
the humerus, were removed, after an incision had been made
through the external parts for the purpose. Three mouths
after the receipt of the injury, the man was sent to England,
with no other inconvenience than that resulting from the
loss of motion in the shoulder, which was stiff. The use of
the forearm was preserved, and a limited one of the upper
arm, by moving the shoulder-bone on the trunk.</p>

<p>Private Oxley, 23d Regiment, was wounded at the battle
of Toulouse, in April, 1814, by a musket-ball, which entered
at the anterior edge of the deltoid muscle, passed across the
head of the humerus, injuring it in its course, and went out
near the posterior edge of the muscle, through which, at its
middle part, the deficiency in the rotundity of the head of
the humerus could be distinctly felt. Shown to me a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
days afterward as a slight but peculiar wound, it was marked
as a case for excision, if circumstances should render it necessary.
No bad symptoms, however, supervened; the man
only complained of the restraint put upon him, and the lowness
of his diet. Some pieces of bone came away, or were
removed, and in July he was sent to England, the wound
being healed and free from pain; the shoulder stiff. The
lower arm he used as before the accident.</p>

<p>General Lord Seaton suffered from a nearly similar wound,
at the taking of Ciudad Rodrigo, and recovered with a good
use of his arm.</p>

<p>These cases were fortunate in their results, but such do
not always follow. Major C. was wounded in one of the
battles in the Pyrenees, in 1813, by a musket-ball, which
injured the head of the left humerus from side to side.
Thirty years afterward the wounds still discharged, and
gave him great uneasiness. A probe discovered much diseased
bone. I advised the excision of the head of the bone,
to which he would not assent. His courage had been broken
by continued suffering.</p>

<p>Ensign Moore, of the Bengal army, was wounded at Sobraon,
on the 10th February, 1846, by a musket-ball, which
passed through the anterior and inner part of the deltoid
muscle, one inch and a half below the inner part of the acromion
process, struck and went through the head of the bone,
which it splintered, and made its exit behind, in front of,
but near the inferior angle of the scapula. He remained in
camp three days, and was sent to hospital at Ferozapore,
where he suffered much from inflammation, pain, etc., and
after a month was sent to Subaltro in the Hills, where some
pieces of bone came away, during which time he suffered
severely, and was much weakened by it and the discharge.
On the 20th October, 1846, he was removed to Bunda, in
Bundeleund; here more bone came away, accompanied by
much discharge. Thence he proceeded in April, 1847, to
Juanpore, where he suffered three attacks of inflammation,
two of them very severe; the constitutional disturbance was
great. The posterior wound was reopened, and a large
quantity of offensive matter discharged. On the 7th of
August, 1847, the suppuration is stated to have been still
great, and the strength very much reduced, on which account
he was recommended to proceed to Europe. On the
9th June, 1848, the wounds were healed, the last piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
bone having come away about ten days before. The pieces
of bone are from the head and from the part adjoining.
The head of the bone is greatly diminished in size, so much
so as to appear to have been almost entirely removed; the
joint is stiff, if not anchylosed, the shoulder flat, the under
use of the arm perfect, that of the upper part dependent on
the motion of the shoulder-blade. The removal of the head
of the bone, immediately after the receipt of the injury, would
have been the best course to have pursued, for the arm when
the cure took place was not in a better state than it would
have been in if the operation had been performed at first,
and the patient would have been spared two years of great
suffering, not unattended with considerable danger.</p>

<p>M. Baudens, in a very able paper, an extract of which,
made by himself, is published in the “Comptes Rendus” of
the French Academy of Sciences, for February, 1855, on the
Resection of the Head of the Humerus, seems to have overlooked,
or not to have seen, the foregoing observations, as
he assumes, as a consequence of his own observations on
fourteen primary cases of which one only died, that the
resection of the head of the humerus ought to be the rule
in surgery when a ball has broken this part, and that amputation
of the limb should be the exception&mdash;a point long
since settled in my surgical works.</p>

<p>He considers that surgical writers in general have supposed
that the bone remains suspended in the middle of the
muscles, which does not accord with his practice, nor with
the remarks made by me on this subject.</p>

<p>He recommends the following mode of operating: The
arm being slightly turned outward and backward, the point
of a small, straight amputating knife is to be entered on the
outside of the coracoid process, immediately over the head
of the humerus; lower the hand and carry the point of the
knife in a straight line for ten or twelve centimeters downward,
always applied to the bone, which serves as a guide.</p>

<p>If the incision thus made should not be large enough to
expose the head of the humerus, a transverse subcutaneous
one should be made through the muscular fibers toward the
superior angle. If it be sufficiently large and open, this is
not necessary. The long tendon of the biceps will be seen
at the bottom of the incision, and is to be cut across.</p>

<p>Bring opposite the incision, by rotating the arm, first the
great tuberosity, then the smaller one, in order to divide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
four muscles attached to them. The division of these parts
will largely open the joint, when the elbow being carried
backward and upward, the head of the bone will protrude.
Detach gently the periosteum, slip the chain saw behind and
below the head of the bone, so as to leave the periosteum
as much uninjured as possible, doing in fact a sub-periosteal
extirpation.</p>

<p>Tie the vessels, cover the upper end of the humerus with
the periosteum thus saved like a hood, and keep it in contact
with the glenoid cavity.</p>

<p>He maintains that when a ball has broken the head of
the humerus, if the removal of the head be not effected, one
of three things follows: the operation is performed subsequently,
or the patient dies of purulent deposits, or recovers
with a stiff joint, accompanied by fistulous openings of a
disagreeable nature.</p>

<p>He contends that a ginglymoid joint is always formed by
his method, which enables the sufferer to make much greater
use of it than if the operation were performed in any other
way; but it will be very difficult of performance if the bone
should be so much injured as to prevent the tuberosity
following the motion to be given to the elbow, and is not
therefore recommended.</p>

<p>119. If, from some complication of injury, the axillary or
other artery should give way during the treatment, the extremity
is not to be amputated. The artery is to be secured
by one ligature applied above the opening in it and by
another below it, the surgeon always bearing in mind the
fact that the proper way to get at the axillary artery is by
cutting <i>across</i> the fibers of the pectoral muscle, and not in
their direction, and that it will be better to amputate the
arm than to tie the subclavian artery above the clavicle.</p>

<p>120. <i>Amputation of the arm</i> by the common circular
incision should only be practiced in the space between the
lower edge of the insertion of the pectoralis major and the
elbow-joint; and rarely in cases of injury from musket-balls.
No common flesh-wound, made either by cannon or musket-shot,
even including a division of the artery, absolutely demands
this operation, the bone being uninjured. If, in
addition to a destructive flesh-wound, the bone be broken,
or if it be mashed with the muscles by an oblique stroke of
a round shot, or the forearm be carried away or destroyed,
it is admissible. It is to be done in the following manner:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
An assistant draws up the integuments with both hands;
another does the same downward, if the parts admit of it;
the forearm is to be moderately bent. The integuments are
to be divided by a circular incision, and retracted. The
muscles and vessels are then to be cut through by one sweep
of the knife, if it can be done. The muscles adhering to the
bone are next to be separated from it to the extent of two
inches. The retractor is to be applied, and the periosteum
divided by one circle of the knife around the bone, and in
the circle thus cut the saw is to work until the bone is
divided; attention being paid to the directions already given
to saw in a perpendicular, not slanting direction. The artery
or arteries are to be tied, the surface of the stump cleansed
with warm and then with cold water, and dried. Leaden
sutures are useful.</p>

<p>121. Mr. Luke performs the operation by two flaps on
the same principle as in the thigh. There is a close resemblance
in the manner of amputating the arm by the double-flap
operation to that adopted for the amputation of the
thigh. The first flap is made posteriorly to the bone, by
transfixing the limb, for which purpose the knife is entered
at the mid-point between the anterior and posterior surfaces,
carried transversely across the limb, and made to cut toward
the posterior surface, in an oblique direction, until all the
soft structures are divided. It is necessary, in entering the
knife, to bear in mind that the bone lies opposite to the
mid-point, and that, in carrying the knife across the limb, it
would strike against the surface of the bone, unless means
were adopted for its prevention. This is easily done by
grasping the structures which are to form the posterior flap
between the fingers and thumb of the left hand, and by
drawing them backward during the time the knife is entering
at the mid-point and being carried across the limb. Having
formed the posterior flap, the anterior one is formed as in
amputation of the thigh, by cutting inward from the surface
toward the bone with a sweep, which will make this flap
equal in length to the posterior. The operation is completed
by dividing the remaining soft parts by means of a
cut carried circularly around the bone, and by sawing the
bone in the line of division. The after-treatment is the
same as in the thigh.</p>

<p>122. <i>Excision of the elbow-joint.</i>&mdash;An incised wound
of moderate extent into the elbow-joint, cutting off with it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a part of the condyle of the humerus, or the head of the
radius, or a part of the ulna, demands the removal of the
injured piece of bone only. The forearm should be bent,
and the antiphlogistic treatment fully carried out. A ball
fracturing the olecranon, or other portion of a single bone,
although opening into the joint, does not immediately require
any operation.</p>

<p>If a ball should lodge in the lower part of the humerus,
or in either of its condyles, it should be removed as quickly
as possible by the trephine, or other appropriate instrument.</p>

<p>When the articulating ends of the humerus, radius, and
ulna are wholly or in part injured by a musket-ball, it was
formerly the custom to amputate the arm in such instances
of great mischief&mdash;an operation which should be superseded
by that of excision of the joint, by which the forearm will
be saved, and considerable use of it retained.</p>

<p>To perform this operation, a straight, strong-pointed knife
is to be pushed into the joint behind, immediately above but
close to the olecranon process, and exactly at its inner edge,
to avoid the ulnar nerve, which lies between it and the inner
condyle, to which it may be considered to be affixed. The
incision thus begun is to be carried outwardly to the external
part of the humerus, dividing the insertion of the triceps.
At each end of this transverse cut an incision is to be made
upward and downward for about two inches each way, the
three resembling the letter <b>H</b>. The flaps thus made being
turned up and down, the olecranon should be sawn across,
together with the great sigmoid cavity and the coronoid
process of the ulna, the insertion of the brachialis internus
having been previously separated from the coronoid process.
Before this is done, the ulnar nerve should be separated with
its attachments from the inner condyle, and turned aside to
avoid injury. The joint being now fully exposed, the head
of the radius may be sawn off or cut through with the strong
spring scissors if possible, above the tubercle into which the
biceps tendon is inserted. The extremity of the humerus
should next be pushed through the wound, and the broken
end sawn off, a spatula or other thin solid substance being
placed underneath it, to prevent the brachial artery or median
nerve being injured. Any hemorrhage which there
may be having ceased, the forearm is to be bent, the bones
are to be placed in apposition, and the incisions approximated
by sutures and sticking-plaster, duly supported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
compress and bandage, so that union may take place if possible,
particularly of the transverse wound first made. The
arm should be supported by a sling, and dressed early, as
the shot-hole or holes must remain open and discharging.
Some motion of the new joint to be formed may be expected
under gentle passive movements; but as a stiff joint cannot
always be avoided, the arm should be kept bent.</p>

<p>123. <i>Amputation of the elbow-joint</i> has been recommended,
but not frequently performed. It may be done in
any way by which good covering can be obtained, and it
has been supposed that the long stump thus made is more
useful if the olecranon process be sawn across, and left with
the triceps attached to it, than if it be removed. When the
parts are sound, a flap may be made in front by introducing
a straight, double-edged knife over the outer condyle, and
carrying it across and through the soft parts over the opposite
or inner condyle, when by cutting downward and outward
a flap is to be formed of from three to four fingers’ breadth
in length. A shorter flap is to be made behind, when both
are to be raised, and the bleeding vessels previously secured,
the external lateral ligament being divided. The radius is
to be separated from the humerus, when the olecranon may
be sawn across, or, if the arm be bent, separated from the
humerus without difficulty. The flaps are to be brought
together and retained in the usual manner.</p>

<p>124. <i>Amputation of the forearm</i> is seldom required after
wounds from musket-balls. The bones can be readily got
at, and large pieces removed with ease. The arteries can
be cut down upon and secured without difficulty, except at
the upper part, and even there with some little sacrifice of
muscular parts, which are not to be spared. The fascia may
be divided freely in every direction, and as mortification from
defect of nourishment rarely takes place in the fingers, as it
does in the toes, when the great arteries of the limb have
been injured, every effort should be made to save a forearm,
however badly it may at first appear to be injured.</p>

<p>The flap operation is to be preferred to the circular, particularly
when done a little above the wrist; to which operation
Baron Larrey and the surgeons of France particularly
objected during the late war. Having done it most successfully
since 1806, however, it is recommended as preferable
to any other, even when the injury admits of its being done
neat the carpus. When the nature of the injury does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
admit of two equal flaps being formed, it must be done by
two unequal ones, or even by one, it being important for
the fixing of an artificial hand or other help to have a long
stump.</p>

<p>The arm being placed and held firmly in the intermediate
position between pronation and supination, with the thumb
uppermost, so that the radius and ulna are in one line, a
sharp-pointed straight knife is to be entered close to the
inner edge of the radius, and brought out below at the inner
edge of the ulna. It is then to be carried forward for half
an inch, and made to cut its way out with a gentle inclination,
so as to form a semicircular flap. Re-entered at the
same point as before, a similar flap is to be made on the
outside, the position of the bones being a little altered to
admit of its easy execution. The two flaps are to be turned
back; the tendon of the supinator radii longus, and all
other tendinous, muscular, or interosseous fibers, not cut
through, are then to be divided, and the linen retractor run
between the bones, which are to be sawn across at the same
time. All pressure being taken off, the tendons and the
vessels, if long, are to be cut short, and the arteries to be
tied, after which the flaps are to be brought together by
sutures, and retained by sticking-plaster, compress, and
bandage.</p>

<p>125. When the operation is to be performed above the
middle of the arm, it may be done by the <i>circular</i> incision.</p>

<p>The arm being placed with the thumb uppermost, an assistant
should retract the integuments as much as possible,
while the operator makes a circular incision through them.
They are then to be drawn up for nearly an inch. The
muscles on the inside of the arm should be divided by one
slanting cut to the bones; then those on the outside. The
bones are to be cleared by cutting through any muscular
fibers attached to them, when the interosseal ligament should
be divided, and the linen retractor passed between the bones,
which may be sawn through at the same time without difficulty.
The stump is to be dressed in the usual manner.
The operation may be done by cutting through the integuments
and muscles at once in an oblique manner, until the
flaps thus formed shall be sufficiently large to make a thick
cushion over the ends of the bones.</p>

<p>126. <i>Amputation at the wrist</i>, or the joint of the radius
and ulna with the first row of the bones of the carpus, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
been recommended by some surgeons as preferable to amputation
above the ends of the radius and ulna. The hand
being placed midway between pronation and supination, the
soft parts are to be divided by a circular incision beginning
from half an inch to an inch below the ends of the radius
and ulna. The integuments being turned up without the
tendons, they are to be divided, and the joint is to be opened
into before the spinous process of the radius; and, while the
hand is pressed down, the knife should divide all the soft
parts, and separate the carpus from the radius and ulna.
The wound is to be closed by sutures in the usual manner.
When a circular incision cannot be made, in consequence of
the nature of the injury, and this operation is still preferred,
a covering for the bones must be obtained wherever it can be
procured, by one or more flaps.</p>

<p>127. <i>In all injuries of the hand</i>, the value of a thumb
and a finger, or of two fingers, or even of one, should be
borne in mind, and no part should be removed that can be
saved, and appears likely to be of use. When cannon-shot,
large splinters of shells, or grape-shot have struck the hand,
amputation will often be necessary; but the foregoing precept
should never be forgotten.</p>

<p>A musket-ball fairly passing through the hand generally
fractures two metacarpal bones, although a small ball may
pass between them without breaking either. The wounds
should be enlarged, and the broken ends of the bone sawn
off, or the splinters removed, and the points of bone smoothed
off, the tendons to be carefully preserved, and vigorous antiphlogistic
measures adopted. The tendency to tetanus or
trismus will be best obviated by such measures, the incisions,
when necessary, being made in the direction of the bones
and tendons. Any hemorrhage which can ensue will be
readily commanded by ligature, by torsion of the vessel, or
by a small graduated compress and bandage, when those are
inapplicable. Injuries by musket-balls to the metacarpal
bones rarely take place without implicating one or more
flexor or extensor tendons, and the consequence is that the
fingers to which they belong are often bent inward toward
the palm, constituting a defect less inconvenient, however,
than if the finger remained straight and immovable.</p>

<p>128. When one or more fingers are destroyed, and the
metacarpal bones injured, they are to be sawn or cut off, but
not removed at the carpus, although an opening into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
joint of the carpus will generally do well, if skin can be
saved to cover it. In all cases of amputation of one or more
fingers, the metacarpal bones, if injured, should be left as
long as possible, and particularly that of the index finger,
when the thumb remains. In all cases it is better, if possible,
to leave the heads of the metacarpal bones in their
places, rather than open into the joint of the carpus, if it
can be avoided. If the articulating heads must come out,
a strong, thin scalpel is to be pushed in between the bones,
the ligaments cut through above, below, and at the sides,
and care should be taken, in removing one or two of these
bones, not to dislocate the others, and the joint should be
covered by a flap or flaps made for the purpose, the sides of
the remaining fingers being covered in a similar manner.
This succeeds admirably, when the two outer bones and fingers
only are taken away.</p>

<p>129. <i>The phalanges</i> of the fingers may be removed by
making a flap from the upper or under part, or from both,
or from the sides. The square flap from the upper part of
the finger is preferable, when the joint with the metacarpal
bone is to be operated upon, the commencing points of the
flap being united by a transverse incision on the under part
of the joint. It should be recollected, that in all these excisions
the larger end of bone belongs to that which is not
removed, as may be shown by bending the finger; and that
the ligamentous attachment between the metacarpal bones,
connecting a middle one to its fellows on each side, should
be cut through, when the joint will be easily dislocated.
Attention should be paid to the division of the lateral ligaments,
in the removal of any of the bones of the fingers.</p>

<p>Professor B. Langenbeck has operated in some instances,
and he says successfully, without the loss of the finger, by
sawing off, in his first case, the articulating ends of the first
phalanx and of the metacarpal bone of the forefinger, in
consequence of an injury from a rotating piece of machinery;
in another, the ends of the first and second phalanges of the
middle finger after a severe laceration; and in a third case,
by sawing off the end of the second phalanx, and removing
the whole of the bone of the third of the forefinger from the
soft parts, leaving the nail; the man recovering with a shortened
but useful finger. In all these cases the flexor and
extensor tendons were from the first uninjured.</p>

<p>M. Langenbeck has also removed the metacarpal bone of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the thumb in the following manner: “An incision is to be
made along the whole length of the bone toward the palmar
aspect, thus avoiding the tendons. Then free both articulating
extremities, separate the soft parts from the body of
the bone, which is to be drawn outward by a strong pair of
forceps, with two bent points or teeth at each extremity.
To prevent the shortening or drawing inward of the thumb,
it is to be kept straight and duly extended by a splint and
other apparatus.” He recommends, with Flourens, the
preservation of as much as possible of the periosteum, and
uses for its detachment a small curved knife with a square
end. Separating the periosteum from the bone is more
easily directed than done. Professor Quekett, at my request,
made some trials on the humerus to ascertain the
point, and found that the periosteum could not be separated
from the cartilaginous covering of the head of the bone, in
the manner proposed, although it could be done by scraping
half an inch below the insertion of the capsular ligament,
and a sufficient portion saved to cover the sawn end of the
bone, in the manner recommended by M. Baudens.</p>

<p class="h2sub">SECONDARY AMPUTATIONS, ETC.</p>

<p>130. <i>Secondary amputations</i>, or those performed after
the lapse of six or more weeks from the receipt of an injury,
when suppuration has been fully established, are not as
successful in military as in civil hospitals, in which these
operations are more commonly performed for incurable diseases
than for injuries. When, however, they are done in
them for injuries, they are not equally successful.</p>

<p>131. In military warfare these amputations are frequently
done from necessity, not choice, after the first forty-eight
hours; and especially after four or five days to the end of
six weeks, in parts which have been lately, or are still affected
by some of the accompaniments of inflammation, or are
in a state of irritation. In these cases the cellular or areolar
tissue has become firmer and more compact than usual;
the muscles are not perfectly healthy; the blood-vessels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
larger and more numerous, and ready to assume actions unusual
to them in a state of health. Where the bones have
been diseased, much bony matter may be deposited between
the muscles, and in some cases the vessels even are surrounded
by it. After a few hours’ remission, the constitutional
symptoms often return, the wound sloughs, and secondary
hemorrhage is not an infrequent consequence. The
ligatures are a source of irritation, and prevent union, which,
in fact, should not in such cases be attempted, and, if attempted,
will as rarely succeed.</p>

<p>132. In these states of constitutional derangement, inflammation
of the veins and sloughing of the stump are not
uncommon, augmented by, if not dependent in some degree
on, the state of the atmosphere, which in autumn, the season
for many military movements, gives rise to endemic fevers,
and even to dysenteries and cholera, which the soldier is
often so unfortunate as to acquire in crowded hospitals. If
the man should escape with life, a joint will frequently be
lost which might have been saved, if the operation had been
performed in the first instance below it. When the injury
is in the thigh, this is a most important point for consideration.</p>

<p>133. If the sufferer should escape these dangers, there
remain the sudden and usually disastrous affections from
depositions of matter in the viscera, alluded to in aphorisms
58, 59, 60, 61, and 62, which are by no means so common
when the patient is in better health; the connection of these
with inflammation of the veins deserves a more close investigation
than has as yet been bestowed upon it by civil or by
military surgeons since attention was first drawn to it by
me in 1815.</p>

<p>134. In secondary amputations in parts which have partaken
of the extensive irritation which accompanies the
original injury, more of the soft parts must be preserved,
although they cannot be said to be unsound. In other
words, the bone must be cut shorter, or the stump will be
conical and bad, particularly if sinuses containing pus are
found to run up between the muscles, or between them and
the bone itself&mdash;a state very likely to give rise subsequently
to caries.</p>

<p>In sawing the bone, it may be again stated, the point of
the saw should incline downward, and when two-thirds of
the bone have been divided, it should be made to cut per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>pendicularly,
whereby the <i>side</i> next the operator is the last
part divided; the hazard of splintering the bone at that
moment will then be avoided, particularly if the limb to be
removed be held with great steadiness.</p>

<p>135. In secondary amputations, twice, nay, three times
the number of arteries will often bleed as in primary ones.
In the thigh, the femoral artery should be drawn out with
a tenaculum or spring forceps, and tied firmly with a single
thread of dentists’ silk, one of the two ends being cut off
close to the knot. The smaller the vessel, the smaller the
thread required. Torsion or twisting the smaller vessels,
so as to rupture their inner coats, answers very well in cases
in which many small ones bleed. When a nerve is known
to accompany an artery, it should be carefully separated
from it.</p>

<p>136. If the bleeding should continue from above the ligature
on the extremity of an artery, it is generally caused
by some small branch given off from it, which has been cut
so close to the trunk of the vessel as not to have been observed.
In that case, the artery itself should be drawn out
by the tenaculum or spring forceps until the bleeding point
can be seen, and a ligature placed above it, when the piece
below should be cut off with the first ligature applied. This
inconvenience will be in general avoided by taking care to
divide the principal artery at one stroke of the knife, and
with it half an inch at least of the surrounding tissues, if the
operation be done by the circular incision; if by flaps, the
extent of the exposed arteries should be carefully examined,
and the ligatures applied at the highest point of exposure,
when all below should be removed.</p>

<p>137. When a tourniquet is used, and applied too close to
the incised parts, it often prevents, even when loosened, the
principal vessel from being found, from its having pressed
on the ends of the muscles. If one be used, it should be
removed as soon as possible after the principal artery has
been secured. The repeated tightening and loosening of
the tourniquet will cause more vessels to bleed in the end,
and more blood to be lost, than if it had not been used; it
ought not, therefore, to be resorted to when good assistance
is procurable. In cases of this kind, in which the stump may
not cease to ooze, the circulation being good, and sponging
with cold water not effectual, the wound should not be finally
closed for two, four, or more hours, until the oozing has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
ceased, and the parts can be freed from the coagulated blood,
and brought together.</p>

<p>138. In cases in which union is not expected to take place,
both ends of the ligature should be cut off; for union of the
external parts is not to be desired in many instances of secondary
amputation, particularly after serious injuries; the
inflammation consequent on which has in some degree implicated
the structures divided in the operation, rendering
them less liable to take on the healthy action of adhesion.
The soft parts should be simply approximated by two or
more sutures, the edges of the wound having a piece of lint
or fine linen between them. This precaution should be particularly
attended to after a great battle, when it is perceived
that from the air, the crowded state of the hospital, or the
season of the year, the stumps, although they may appear
to unite in the first instance externally, do not in reality do
so internally.</p>

<p>139. It has been proposed to use ligatures made of cat-gut
or other animal substances, which may be cut short, and
left in the wound to be absorbed. This has taken place in
some instances, while in others little abscesses have followed,
allowing their discharge, and not expediting the cure, so
that the practice has not prevailed; it is said that greater
success has attended in America ligatures used in this way
made of very fine shreds of the strong tendons of the large
deer of that country. Ligatures should not be applied on
large veins when they continue to bleed, if it can be avoided,
although it has frequently been done without subsequent
inconvenience. A little delay and moderate pressure will
generally suffice to arrest the bleeding.</p>

<p>140. If the surgeon find, after completing the operation,
that the bone cannot be sufficiently covered to make a good
stump, a piece should be sawn off at once, and the error
remedied, with little comparative inconvenience to what
would occur afterward, if the bone be too long. No false
shame should prevent its being done. If, however, the error
have occurred, and the end of bone should become uncovered
during the process of healing, it may be allowed to separate
of itself, as it cannot be sawn off at this period without difficulty
and much suffering; for an exposed surface will then
remain, from which an exfoliation will take place before the
stump can heal. In cases of great protrusion, an incision
should be made down to the bone, which should be firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
held by strong forceps, or by a tube in which it will fit, when
it is to be sawn off by the chain saw at a sound part, above
that which has been exposed. The wound, in all cases,
should be well supported by compress and bandage, to secure
a good stump; whence the necessity for the bone being
shorter than in those secondary amputations which are done
at the period of election, and which will, on the contrary,
often unite without difficulty. In primary operations, cold
water is most applicable in the first instance; in secondary
amputations, warmth by fomentations, rather than by even
the lightest of poultices.</p>

<h3 class="center">ON COMPOUND FRACTURES.</h3>

<p>141. A fracture of a bone, however <i>simple</i> it may be in
its nature, is said to be <i>compound</i> when accompanied by an
external opening in, or a wound of, the soft parts, communicating
with the broken bone&mdash;a complication which usually
gives rise to ulcerative inflammation and suppuration throughout
the whole extent of the injury, preventing thereby those
milder processes being effected which, under the more favorable
circumstances of the skin being unbroken, lead to a
speedy union of the broken parts; whence the desire manifested
by the surgeon, in ordinary cases of compound fracture,
to close the external wound, if possible, but which,
from the nature of a gunshot wound, it is useless to attempt.
A fracture is said to be <i>comminuted</i> when the bone is
crushed, as by a heavy wheel passing over it. It may still,
however, be a <i>simple</i> fracture, that is, without an external
wound; and in that state it is much less dangerous than a
similar injury accompanied by an external opening, however
small, the edges of which cannot be immediately and permanently
reunited.</p>

<p>142. An arm or a leg, as a general rule, is not to be amputated
in the first instance for a compound fracture caused
by a musket-ball, unless the ball be of large size, and the
bone much shattered. An effort should always be made to
save it; and, under reasonable circumstances with regard to
the extent of injury, the comfort, climate, and ordinary good
health of the sufferer, the object will frequently be obtained
under good surgical treatment.</p>

<p>143. It is not so with the thigh. After the battle of
Toulouse, forty-three of the best of the fractures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
thigh were attempted to be saved under my direction, and
even selection. Of this number thirteen died; twelve were
amputated at the secondary period, of whom seven died; and
eighteen retained their limbs. Of these eighteen, the state
three months after the battle was: five only could be considered
well, or as using their limbs; two more thought their
limbs more valuable, although not very serviceable, than a
wooden leg; and the remaining eleven wished they had suffered
amputation at first. Of the officers with fracture of
the femur, one (having been taken prisoner during the action)
died under the care of the French surgeons, by whom
he was skillfully treated; the other has preserved a limb,
which he rather wishes had been exchanged for a wooden
leg.</p>

<p>In the five successful cases, the injury was in all at or
below the middle of the thigh. In the thirteen others who
retained their limbs, the injury was not above the middle
third; and of those who died unamputated, several were
near or in the upper third, and either died before the proper
period for secondary amputation, or were not ultimately in
a state to undergo that operation. Of the seven amputations
which died, two were at the little trochanter, by the
flap operation; and the others were for the most part unfavorable
cases. In one case only was the head or neck of
the bone fractured. The man lived for two months, and,
from the dreadful sufferings he endured, it was much regretted
that he had not lost his limb at the hip-joint at first.
The operation ought, however, to have been the removal of
the head and neck of the bone; but he was not seen in
time by those who could or would have done this operation,
which was then, however, only contemplated for the first time.</p>

<p>Nearly all the wounded, after this battle, had every possible
assistance and comfort, from the second day after the
action. The hospitals were well supplied with bedsteads&mdash;no
inconsiderable point in the treatment of fractures&mdash;and
several of the surgeons had been in almost every battle from
the commencement of the war. The medicines and materials
for their treatment were in profusion. The sick and
wounded (1359 in number, including 117 officers) were in
charge of two deputy inspectors-general, ten staff-surgeons,
six apothecaries, and fifty-one assistant-surgeons; and the
whole worked from morning until evening with the greatest
assiduity. The surgery of the British army was then at the
highest point of perfection it attained during the war; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
this enumeration is given to show the number of medical
men required under the most favorable circumstances for
1500 wounded men, if they are to have all the aid surgery
can give them. Doctors are not the most ornamental part
of an army perhaps, but there are days in a campaign when
many poor fellows find them to be the most useful.</p>

<p>Every broken thigh or leg was in the straight position,
and the success was greater than on any previous occasion.
Nevertheless, with all these advantages, there can be little
doubt that if amputation had been performed in the first instance,
on the thirty-six out of the forty-three who died or
only partially recovered, some twenty would have survived,
able, for the most part, to support themselves with a moderate
pension, instead of there being perhaps five, or at
most ten, nearly unable to do anything for themselves.
Baron Larrey, with the <i>élite</i> of the military surgeons of
France, as well as of those of Germany, have maintained
this opinion; and the result of the practice as yet observed
in the Crimea essentially confirms it, partly from the greater
extent of mischief done to the bone by the large needle two-ounce
rifle bullets of the Russians, and partly perhaps from
the want of the accommodation and appliances which the
circumstances of the siege of Sebastopol did not admit of.
In the present state of our knowledge, it is perhaps the
safest practice, particularly under doubtful circumstances, in
which it cannot be ascertained whether rest, the best surgical
care, and comfort may not be wanting; without all which
a favorable result cannot be expected.</p>

<p>144. War is an agreeable occupation, trade, or professional
employment for the few only, not for the many; and
particularly not for the poor, when they have the misfortune
to have their limbs broken by musket-shot. There are very
few men in England who know what are the first principles
of a medico-military movement with an army in the field;
and it will not materially signify whether there should be
even one so instructed, until the nation at large shall be impressed
with the idea that no expense, no trouble, ought to
be spared to obtain for their soldiers so unhappily injured
the utmost comfort and accommodation that can be procured
for them, as well as the best surgical assistance. The first
was little attended to in England during three-fourths of the
Peninsular war; and the latter was supposed to be obtained,
when the demand was urgent, by giving a warrant to kill or
cure to persons as dressers who were unable to undergo an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
examination with any prospect of success, and prove themselves
worthy a commission. Many a gallant soldier lost
his life from the want of that proper attendance and care
alluded to; many a desolate and unhappy mother mourned
the loss of a son she need not have mourned for under happier
circumstances, and who might have been the support,
the happiness, of her declining years. Yet England calls
herself the most humane, as well as the greatest, nation
upon earth; she claims to be the most civilized, and she
may be so; but certainly, in the case of those who have
hitherto fallen in her defense, she could not on many occasions
have been more careless or less compassionate. I have
endeavored to impress on the directors of the East India
Company in particular the injustice, the carelessness, of their
treatment of the wounded soldiers of the royal army of Great
Britain. My remonstrances have hitherto been in great part
useless. It is to be hoped, however, that the present War
Minister will cause an official public inquiry to be made into
this matter, for that alone can cause this grievance to be redressed.
Old habits are not to be overcome but by public
opinion.</p>

<p>145. The peculiar difficulty in treating a gunshot fracture
takes place when the bone is splintered for some distance,
as well as broken. In these cases, inflammation
occurs internally in the membranous covering of the cancellated
structure of the bone, ending in the death of the parts
affected; while the periosteum takes on that peculiar action
externally which ends in the deposition of ossific matter
around the splinters which have lost their life, and are enveloped
by it. The bony matter, at first small in quantity,
is gradually augmented, and deposited for some distance in
the surrounding parts, so that it has been known to include
the neighboring vessels and nerves in less than twenty days;
at the end of a few weeks the quantity of ossific deposit is
often very remarkable. Each splinter of bone becomes the
sequestrum of a necrosis, in a similar manner as it is known
to occur in the bones of young persons spontaneously affected
by that disease, with this essential difference, that in the
idiopathic disease there is only <i>one</i>, as if worm eaten, sequestrum,
perhaps the length of the shaft of the bone, easily
removable by one operation, while there may be in the traumatic
disease several dead centers of ossific deposit, each of
which requires to be removed by an operation to effect a
cure. This new bony deposit will often be half an inch and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
more in thickness, and at a late period is as hard as the old
bone. The repetition of operations required in such cases
is very distressing, particularly in the thigh, in which the
disease often continues for months, and even for years.</p>

<p>The following case, related by Colonel Wilton, is instructive:
“Lieutenant Timbrell, late of my old regiment, the 31st,
had both his thighs broken at the battle of Sobraon; he
would not allow amputation, so the doctor put him in a
boarded ‘dooley,’ and his legs in a kind of trough. As I
was also wounded, I used to see him almost daily, and I
never heard him complain except the days when the doctor
tried to extend his legs. Some time after our return to
England (perhaps seven or eight months) I went to visit
him, and found him quite recovered, and able to enjoy a
day’s shooting as well as most people. He showed me many
pieces of bone which had come away from his wounds, and
appeared to have lost about three inches of his height; his
limbs were rather bowed. He is now paymaster of the 6th
Foot; and when I saw him, a few days before he embarked
for the Cape, he was as active as ever, although I do not
think he could either run or jump.”</p>

<p>146. A musket-ball will often lodge in the less dense
parts of bones, such as the great trochanter or the condyles
of the femur, without fracturing the bone; it will sometimes
even pass through the femur above and between the condyles,
merely splitting, but without separating the bone in parts
or pieces. Balls sometimes lodge in the shaft of the femur
without breaking it, and frequently do so in the tibia, the
humerus, the bones of the cranium, and even in others of
less size. Balls thus lodged will sometimes remain for years&mdash;nay,
during a long life&mdash;without causing much inconvenience.
It is, however, generally the reverse, and they are
often the cause of so much irritation and distress that the
sufferers are willing to have them, and even their limbs, removed
at last at any risk. Whenever, then, a ball can be
felt sticking in a bone, although it cannot be brought into
view, it should, if possible, be dislodged and removed by the
trephine, by small chisels, by small, strong-pointed curved
elevators, or by any of the screws invented for the purpose,
which have sometimes been found efficient. An apparently
useful instrument of this kind is attached to the forceps for
extracting balls; it is more frequently used in France than
in England. When the ball can be seen as well as felt, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
surgeon must be guided by his own experience and judgment
with respect to the most fitting instruments. It is to be
removed if possible, whatever may be the means used for its
abduction, after the wound has been properly enlarged for
the purpose.</p>

<p>147. When a ball merely grazes a bone without breaking
it, and passes through the limb, and no splinters can be felt
by the finger, dilatation is unnecessary in the first instance;
although some small splinters may be cast off subsequently,
or a layer of bone may exfoliate, requiring assistance for
their removal.</p>

<p>The bone may be fractured in a case of this kind transversely,
and will require only the simplest treatment in an
almost similar manner.</p>

<p>148. If the ball should enter and be flattened against the
bone without breaking it, and lodge against it or in the soft
parts, it should be sought for and removed. When the ball
is flattened and the bone broken, it may lie between the
broken extremities, and even lodge in one of them, rendering
the case more complicated, and the necessity for close investigation
more urgent. A leaden ball when striking on the
sharp edge of a long bone, such as the spine of the tibia,
has been known to be divided on it, without the bone being
broken. This has happened in the arm.</p>

<p>149. When a ball strikes the shaft of a bone, such as the
femur, directly and with force, it shatters it often in large,
long, and pointed pieces, retaining their attachment to the
muscles inserted into them. A fracture of this nature in the
middle of the thigh will often extend downward into the
condyles, and as high as, although rarely into, the trochanters.
These are cases for immediate amputation.</p>

<p>150. Gunshot fractures of the head and neck of the femur
have hitherto been fatal injuries, unless the whole extremity
has been removed. It is hoped death may be prevented
without this most formidable operation, by the removal of
the head and neck of the bone, according to aphorism 85.
If the upper third of the femur below the trochanter be
badly fractured, and an attempt be made to save the limb,
death generally occurs after several weeks of intense suffering,
more particularly when the bone is broken by the large
two-ounce balls now used by the Russians in the Crimea.</p>

<p>The least dangerous and the most likely to be saved are
fractures of the lower third, or at most of the lower half, of
the thigh-bone. When they do not communicate with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
knee-joint, an attempt ought always to be made to save the
limb.</p>

<p>151. The preservation of a femur fractured by a musket-ball,
when splintered to any extent, ought only to be attempted
if the principal splinters can be removed. When
the splinters of the femur are long and large, it has been
supposed that if they retain their attachment to the soft
parts, they may be placed in apposition and preserved. This
may be doubted. It ought, however, only to be attempted
under the most favorable circumstances, and will not often
succeed even then. In the humerus it is different. An examination
by the finger in the first instance is necessary to
ascertain the extent of the injury to the bone, and to enable
the surgeon to remove the broken portions, as well as the
ball or any extraneous substances which may be in the wound.
The incisions necessarily required for this purpose in the thigh
are sometimes neglected, or the surgeon refrains from making
them from the great thickness of the muscular parts, and
from the wound having taken place on the inside, near the
great vessels, so as to render incisions of sufficient size or
extent in some degree dangerous. The thickness of the
muscular parts is not a sufficient reason for avoiding an incision,
neither is the vicinity of the great vessels and nerves,
although they may not be divided; if the situation of the
bone on the outside of the thigh be attended to, the broken
portions may sometimes be got at at that part, if not on the
inside. If this cannot be done, amputation had better be
had recourse to. The object of the examination of such a
wound being to ascertain the state of the fracture, and to
remove the splinters and any extraneous substances, the extent
and number of the incisions must depend on them; the
true principle of what has been called dilatation of wounds.
If the ball should have merely struck and grazed the bone,
and passed out, causing a transverse fracture only, there is
no necessity for making incisions at the moment, although
one or more may be subsequently required to aid in the discharge
of an exfoliated piece of bone, or of a splinter which
may have been overlooked. If the ball lodge deeply in the
soft parts, after breaking the bone, it should be removed, if
practicable, by a second or counter-opening, and a free vent
should always be made for the discharge. It may, however,
be laid down as a general rule, that whatever is likely to be
required during the first few days had better be done on the
first than on the second or third; for after inflammation has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
commenced, any handling or examination of the limb, however
gently made, gives great pain.</p>

<p>152. After the first incisions have been made, and the
larger splinters, which can be felt, have been removed, a
secondary danger occurs from those which are smaller, and
may have been overlooked, or not been discovered. This
arises from the enveloping of these splinters in the new ossific
matter described as being formed by the inflamed periosteum.
This evil must be prevented by a careful examination
of the wound when suppuration has been fully established,
and the sensibility of the parts is in some degree diminished;
when, if loose splinters of bone can be felt, they ought to be
removed by incisions carefully and gently made to the extent
which may be required. If this be not done early, the ossific
deposit will take place around, and shut them in, even if the
wound should close, which it usually will not. Their retention
is accompanied by a firm thickening of the part, and in
due course of time a spot of inflammation implies the formation
of an abscess, and an ulcerated opening through the
new bony deposit. When this abscess breaks externally,
the probe will pass through the hole in the new bone, and
rest on the rough, dead, and now perhaps movable splinter,
the extraction of which can alone afford permanent relief.
The earlier this is done the softer the ossific matter will be;
at an early period, it will cut like Parmesan cheese intermixed
with lime. If deferred until the bony matter is quite
hard, it must be cut through with the chisel, or bone scissors
or forceps, the application of which sometimes requires
great force.</p>

<p>153. The successful treatment of a gunshot fracture of the
thigh cannot be effected while the patient is lying on a little
straw or a mat on the ground, and proper bedsteads should
always form a part of the hospital stores of an army in the
field. There is one in use at the Westminster Hospital, and
another at the Royal Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital,
which may be taken as models. Each, when complete, with
mattress, etc., costs ten pounds, and, with a second inclined
plane and mattress, might answer for two fractures; six may
be easily carried in any common or spring cart wherever they
are wanted. They would alleviate the sufferings, the horrible
torments, many suffer unnecessarily. There is a very
good and even cheaper one in use in the London Hospital,
well worthy attention. An instrument or iron machine,
movable from bed to bed, has been invented by Dr. Thom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>son,
of Stratford-on-Avon, which lifts a man readily from
his bed, and, after he has been dressed, lays him down again
with ease in a similar manner to the bedstead alluded to.
It has, however, the advantage of being movable, while the
apparatus in the bedstead is fixed. Lord Strafford has sent
one to his regiment, the Coldstream Guards, and Dr. Thomson
has sent another. Young backs and young knees only
can bend for consecutive hours over men lying on the ground.
Doctors of fifty years of age cannot do it; they are physically
unequal to the labor. A staff-surgeon half a century
old on a field of battle is almost an absurdity in the art, if
not in the science of surgery: he ought to be promoted to
the rank of inspector. The custom of the present day is to
promote men more on account of the length of their services
than because of their value: whereas, to make good physicians
and surgeons, it should be from their value, combined
with a due regard to a moderate yet sufficient length of service,
which certainly should never exceed, even if it amounted
to, twenty years; ten or twelve, in time of war, would be
better,&mdash;a matter of expense against life and human misery.</p>

<p>154. The position of the patient in a gunshot fracture
of the thigh or leg is of the utmost importance. He should
lie on his back, and the limb should be straight. It is almost
impossible to keep a man’s thigh in the bent position, or on
its side, without his turning on his back, and the union of the
bone, if it take place at all, must then be at an angle. The
bent position forward, or on an inclined plane, is defective,
inasmuch as the matter, which must necessarily be secreted
in great quantity, will gravitate backward in spite of every
care to prevent it. When a proper bedstead is used, a
slightly inclined plane will sometimes be advantageous at a
later period, when the body may also be raised, even to the
erect position, the principal object being to take off the action
of the two muscles inserted into the smaller trochanter,
which, with the rotators behind, raise and evert the upper
end of the broken bone. This direction outward should be
met by a similar direction of the lower part of the bone, and
by the application, from time to time, of a proper splint,
compress, and bandage on the elevated bone, if they can be
borne with perfect ease.</p>

<p>155. Splints are of various kinds, and made of different
substances. The discovery of gutta-percha has enabled
some to be made of that substance, which, when moulded
into sheets, of from one to two or three eighths of an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in thickness, can be rendered soft and pliable by the application
of hot water, regaining its firmness as it dries. Splints
can thus be made of any size or length, and of any form,
with apertures, if necessary, for the passage of the discharge
from the wounds. Leather tanned without oil, and called
splint-leather, is equally useful; if, when dried, the splints
thus made become too hard, and press unequally, they can
be softened by hot water, and removed and replaced with
little comparative inconvenience.</p>

<p>One wooden splint of more than the length of the limb,
somewhat similar to that called Desault’s, is absolutely necessary
for the thigh, if it can be borne, which it rarely can,
as a means of extension, or rather of preserving length. A
shorter one on the inside, and one behind, will sometimes be
required to complete the set A short one may be wanting
for occasional use in front.</p>

<p>156. The bones of the leg being more exposed, admit of
greater liberties being taken with them, and of larger portions,
or even parts, being taken away successfully, than
ought to be attempted in the thigh. A leg should, therefore,
be seldom amputated for a fracture from a musket-ball.
The splinters should be removed to almost any extent and
number, and irregular portions sawn off from both ends, if
they should be thus implicated. If one bone of the leg remain
uninjured, the case becomes comparatively simple. The
position should be straight on the heel, as a general rule,
admitting of few exceptions.</p>

<p>157. The best apparatus for a compound fracture of the
leg in either civil or military surgery, particularly in the
latter, is that contrived by Mr. Luke, which may be seen in
use at the London Hospital, and is supplied by Mr. M’Lellan,
3 Turner Street, Whitechapel Road. It is a simple
iron cradle of small size, such as is used to guard a limb
from the weight of the bedclothes, composed of three bars
or large segments of a circle, united at their middles and
ends or sides, as all cradles are, by a bar of iron of equal
thickness. This is placed on a board a little wider than
itself, with a ledge or bar at each side to prevent the cradle
from moving, aided by two buttons or little pieces of wood
on each side, which, being movable, turn over the iron bars,
and thus render the board and cradle one firm piece. In
this the leg is to be slung, to the center bar above, by ordinary
tapes. A splint made of copper, to prevent rust or
injury, hollowed to receive the leg, extending beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
foot with a footboard, and beyond the condyles of the femur
above, enables the tapes to be passed under the limb for
slinging it; while from the extension of the splint beyond
the condyles, it causes the leg and thigh to move together,
in a manner which will often prevent the pain which follows
a sudden motion of the patient. Solid wooden side splints
are still wanting, and these should have holes cut in them
to allow a vent for the discharge and for the application of
dressings; or if a portion of the splint, say the middle, should
require removal altogether for this purpose, the upper and
lower parts may be united by a semicircular bar of iron, at
the pleasure of the surgeon; within this the dressings may
be applied, and by it the splint will be rendered firm.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
When the leg is thus slung, the knee will be somewhat bent,
the thigh raised, the muscles of the leg behind relaxed, and
the patient can be moved with much greater facility than
with any other apparatus; one great advantage of this apparatus
is, that it can be used with effect even if the patient
be obliged to lie on the ground. It admits of being slung
as a whole in a spring-cart, by additional but strong, elastic
straps fastened to or applied on the under part of the board,
and thus a double slinging motion may be obtained when the
sufferer is obliged to be moved.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> This apparatus has, I think, been improved upon at the Bristol
Hospital by the addition of a bar on each side of the center one.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-155" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-155.jpg" alt="Apparatus to support lower leg." />
</div>

<p>These splints are so portable that they may be carried
into the field or upon the deck of a ship, to bring the patient
to the surgeon.</p>

<p>In using the apparatus, the back of the leg and lower end
of the thigh are to be evenly supported on a pad placed on
the leg-rest; a splint is to be placed on each side of the leg,
and the whole secured by straps carried around near the
knee and ankle. The leg is then to be suspended by two
straps from the bar of the cradle placed over the leg as represented,
so as to swing without touching the folding board
on which the cradle is placed. The foot should be secured
to the foot-piece by a bandage.</p>

<p>Solid splints, and a firmly-fixed cradle, under which the
leg may hang, may be said to be the <i>sine qua non</i> of the
treatment of a gunshot fracture of the leg. The French in
the Crimea have an apparatus called a <span class="allsmcap">GOUTTIÈRE</span>, to be
hereafter noticed.</p>

<p>158. Half-a-dozen pairs of long poles made light and of
tough wood, which might always be replaced without difficulty,
and a good thick ticking for each pair, having a case
or pipe on each side in which the poles might run, ought to
be a part of the surgical stores of every regiment on service
in time of war. Two short irons, having at each end a ring
through which the poles may run, will keep the ticking or
sacking extended, and the patient flat and immovable unless
shaken by accident. The sacking will roll up into little
compass, if the poles should not be forthcoming or are not
wanted, and, when the ground is damp, will make an excellent
bedstead as well as a covering for the doctor. If four
legs be added to each bearer, a great facility will be obtained
on halting when the carriers are tired, the sufferer being
raised from the ground, which in muddy or boggy places is
very desirable.</p>

<p>159. The <i>arm</i>, when fractured by musket-shot, admits
even of more strenuous efforts being made to save it; from
its smaller size, and the more ready exposure of the bone or
bones when badly broken, the danger is less. If an artery
should yield by ulceration, it should be laid bare by operation,
and a ligature placed on each bleeding end. An additional
or second wound in the forearm only complicates the
case, and the loss of a finger or two does not augment the
danger. In fact, amputation should rarely take place in the
first instance, and only in the second when mortification has
commenced, or the strength and health of the patient will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
no longer bear the drain upon them. The head of the bone
should be removed, with as much of the shaft as may be injured;
the elbow-joint should be excised, if the condyles are
destroyed and the joint injured; if the middle of the bone
should be destroyed, the upper and lower ends of it should
be approximated. A great advantage is derived from the
facility with which the upper extremity can be supported as
compared with the lower, and the aid to the general health
which may be obtained from the locomotion sufferers with
broken arms are capable of undergoing.</p>

<p>160. In making incisions for the removal of splinters of
bone, both at an early and at a late period, particularly in the
latter, when the soft parts are all impacted together, and
<i>nothing is gained beyond what is cut</i>, the course of the
trunks of nerves, as well as of the great arteries, should be
carefully attended to, and those parts avoided; for a successful
cure of the fracture will be much deteriorated in
value, if accompanied by a loss of motion or of sensation in
the hand or fingers.</p>

<p>161. Splints for the arm should be made of solid materials,
although light; some a little hollowed, and at a right
angle, to correspond with the bend of the arm, and to admit
of a little motion of the radius and of the forearm and hand,
which relieves the position, is more comfortable for the sufferer,
and tends to prevent stiffness of the elbow. The pads
of lining for the splints should be made of cleaned or carded
wool, rather than of tow or old linen, protected by some one
or other of the modern modifications of caoutchouc or gutta-percha.</p>

<p>162. The medical treatment of compound fractures should
be directed to allay pain and to prevent as far as possible
any excess of general irritation and fever; to sustain, at a
subsequent period, the strength of the sufferer by appropriate
medicines, good and sufficient diet, and a free circulation
of air, without all which little can be expected, to say nothing
of absolute rest and those ordinary attentions and comforts
so necessary for the restoration of health.</p>

<p>163. The following returns are illustrative of the principles
recommended with reference to primary and secondary
amputations. The first two show the seats of injury in 1359
persons wounded and admitted into hospital after the battle
of Toulouse. The fifth return should be considered rather
as an approximation to the truth than as the exact truth, as

but those only who reached Brussels, and does not include

Of 310 amputations 25 died, 172 recovered in the field,
and 113 were sent to the rear, of whom one-sixth may be
considered to have died, making a total of 45 deaths in 310
cases&mdash;the proportion of upper extremities to lower in the
310 being as 182 to 128, thus greatly influencing the result,
which is consequently much more favorable than if the numbers
had been reversed. The proportion of upper to lower
extremities in the secondary amputations, as by return No.
3, is equally in favor of the upper, and can only be accounted
for, when compared with Return No. 4, by the
army being constantly in motion and the hospitals at a distance.
The difference of results at the several stations is
also remarkable; it is so with the divisions in the field. The
3d and 4th divisions, under Staff-Surgeons Lindsey and Boutflower,
kept their amputations with them in bivouac, and
their success is remarkable; that of the 4th division has no
parallel. The light division, on outpost duty, could not
keep their amputations. These two returns include 886
amputations.</p>

<p>The labors of the surgeons of the army may be judged of
by the fact that, during the last three months of the year to
which these returns refer&mdash;viz., from September 25th to December
24th, 1813&mdash;the number of sick and wounded amounted
to 37,144, a number nearly equal to that of the whole army.</p>

<p class="h2sub">CHARACTERS OF HOSPITAL GANGRENE.</p>

<p>164. This most destructive disease owes its names of hospital
gangrene, phagedena, gangrenosa, <i>pourriture d’hôpital</i>,
sloughing ulcer, etc. etc. to the different appearances the
affected parts assume on different occasions, according to the
intensity of the morbid poison applied, and possibly also to
the state of constitution of the individual attacked. The
peculiar nature of this poison has not yet been ascertained.
Professor Brugmans says that in 1797, in Holland, charpie
composed of linen threads cut of different lengths, which,
on inquiry, it was found had been already used in the great
hospitals in France, and had been subsequently washed and
bleached, caused every ulcer to which it was applied to be
affected by hospital gangrene; and the fact that this disease
was readily communicated by the application of instruments,
lint, or bandages which had been in contact with infected
parts, was too firmly established by the experience of every
one in Portugal and Spain to be a matter of doubt. Its
character as a thoroughly contagious disease is indisputable.
Its capability of being conveyed through the medium of the
atmosphere to an ulcerated surface is also admitted, although
some have thought that the infection was not always applied
to the sore, but affected it secondarily, through the medium
of the constitution. Brugmans says that hospital gangrene
prevailed in one of the low wards at Leyden in 1798, while
the ward or garret above it was free. The surgeon made an
opening in the ceiling between the two, in order to ventilate
the lower or affected ward, and in thirty hours three patients
who lay next the opening were attacked by the disease, which
soon spread through the whole ward. Our experience in
Portugal and Spain confirmed this fact, and left no doubt on
the mind of any one who had frequent opportunities of seeing
the disease, that one case of hospital gangrene was capable
of infecting not only every ulcer in the ward, but in every
ward near it, and ultimately throughout the hospital, however
large. The disease, as long as it remains unaltered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
destructive applications, may be considered to be infectious
as well as contagious.</p>

<p>This infection can penetrate the dressings so as to affect
the ulcer through them, although requiring a difference of
time in different parts of the body. Ulcers on the lower
extremity experienced the influence of the morbid poison in
general at an earlier period than those on the upper extremity;
and a wound might be seen in a healthy state on the
arm, while one on the leg had been evidently suffering from
this disease for some days, if the complaint had become
mild, or somewhat chronic. If the morbid poison were in
its active state, then the deterioration of the ulcers on the
arm was almost if not quite contemporaneous with that on
the leg.</p>

<p>165. Mr. Blackadder has given the following account of
the disease from inoculation in his own person, which is,
therefore, more to be relied upon than any other:&mdash;</p>

<p>“While engaged in examining the stump of a patient who
had died from this disease, I accidentally wounded one of my
fingers with the point of a double-edged scalpel, but so
slightly that not a drop of blood made its appearance, and
on this account I did not consider any particular precautionary
means necessary. In the course of about sixty hours,
however, the wound had become inflamed, and I was attracted
to it by an occasional smart, stinging sensation, which ultimately
extended a considerable way up the arm. On the
fourth day the inflammation had increased, and the stinging
sensation was almost constant. Headache, nausea, and
general indisposition followed, with frequent chills, which
increased very much toward evening; but which, with the
other symptoms, were considerably relieved by the use of
neutral salts, the pediluvium, and warm diluents. A vesicle,
having a depression in its center, and containing a watery
fluid of a livid color, was now forming upon a hard and elevated
base; the surrounding integuments became tumefied,
of an anserine appearance, and extremely sensitive to the
touch; at about the distance of the fourth of an inch from
the base of the tumor, a very distinct areola, of a bluish-red
color, made its appearance, and remained visible for several
days. At this period, circumstances rendered it necessary
for me to be exposed to wet, to undergo considerable fatigue,
and immediately afterward to travel to a considerable distance.
The inflammation, however, gradually subsided, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the stinging, accompanied by a burning sensation, still continued,
and the sore had no disposition to heal; yet it did
not enlarge externally, but was disposed to burrow under
the integuments. This phagedenic disposition was ultimately
got the better of by laying open the sore, and by repeated
applications of caustic; but it was two months before a complete
cicatrix had formed. The new cuticle remained for a
length of time extremely sensitive to the touch; and it was
upwards of six months before it had acquired the color of
the surrounding integuments.”</p>

<p>166. M. Delpech was disposed to consider that the misfortunes
and sufferings of the French army had a great depressing
influence on the soldiers, from which at other times
they would have been exempted, and that this aided the propagation
of the malady; but many soldiers of the British
army, free from these particular depressing causes, suffered
in a similar manner. Dr. Tice, at Coimbra, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An uncommon depressing affection of the mind often
exists among persons suffering from this disease, painful to
witness&mdash;a morbid dejection, or apathy, which could scarcely
be removed, and on which, in very bad cases, no impression
could be made. In others, the humane solicitations of the
medical officers have failed against the influence of oppressive
gloom, amounting to despair. Expectation and hope
seemed to be exiled from their minds by the dominion of
painful despondency, which, prevailing in melancholy disorder,
seemed uncontrolled or checked by the intrusive importunities
of the present, or the consciousness of a future
existence.”</p>

<p>A wound attacked by hospital gangrene in its most concentrated
and active form presents a horrible aspect after
the first forty-eight hours. The whole surface has become
of a dark-red color, of a ragged appearance, with blood,
partly coagulated, and apparently half putrid, adhering at
every point. The edges are everted, the cuticle separating
from half to three-quarters of an inch around, with a concentric
circle of inflammation extending an inch or two
beyond it; the limb is usually swollen for some distance, of
a shining white color, and not peculiarly sensible, except in
spots, the whole of it being perhaps edematous or pasty.
The pain is burning, and unbearable in the part itself, while
the extension of the disease, generally in a circular direction,
may be marked from hour to hour; so that in from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
another twenty-four to forty-eight hours, nearly the whole
of the calf of a leg, or the muscles of a buttock, or even of
the wall of the abdomen, may disappear, leaving a deep,
great hollow, or hiatus, of the most destructive character,
exhaling a peculiar stench, which can never be mistaken, and
spreading with a rapidity quite awful to contemplate. The
great nerves and arteries appear to resist its influence longer
than the muscular structures, but these at last yield; the
largest nerves are destroyed, and the arteries give way, frequently
closing the scene, after repeated hemorrhages, by one
which proves the last solace of the unfortunate sufferer. I
have seen all the largest arteries of the extremities give way
in succession, and until the progress of the disease was arrested
by proper means, the application of a ligature was
useless. The joints offer little resistance; the capsular and
synovial membranes are soon invaded, and the ends of the
bones laid bare. The extension of this disease is, in the first
instance, through the medium of the cellular structure of the
body. The skin is undermined, and falls in; or a painful
red, and soon black patch, or spot, is perceived at some
distance from the original mischief, preparatory to the whole
becoming one mass of putridity, while the sufferings of the
patient are extreme. A complaint of this kind cannot be
local, even if a local origin be admitted; the accompanying
fever is usually dependent on the previous state and general
constitution of the patient, modified by the season of the
year, or the prevailing type of febrile disease.</p>

<p>This gangrenous disease does not always prevail in this,
its most concentrated form; the destroying process assumes
more of a sloughing than of a gangrenous character, whence
Delpech has denominated it pulpous, rather than gangrenous.
It is in its nature almost equally destructive, although not
quite so formidable in appearance. It may attack the whole
surface of an ulcer at once, or in distinct points, all, however,
rapidly extending toward each other, until they constitute
one whole. The red of the granulations becomes of a more
violet color, and the change is accompanied by burning, a
pain not usually felt in the part, while a layer of ash-colored
matter is soon seen covering them, which adheres so firmly
as not to be readily removed; or, if separated, shows that
it is a substance formed upon the surface, and constituting a
part of the granulations themselves, which are ultimately
confounded with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
About the end of the first week, and sometimes much later,
this kind of ulcer becomes more painful, the edges or the circumference
of the wound assume a browner hue, and the
parts become somewhat pasty, the whitish color of the part
particularly affected being opaque, gray, and soft. It may be
said that the false membrane, having become very thick, has
lost the little vitality it possessed, and become putrid; the
discharge, which had been partly suppressed, now reappears,
not as pus, but as a fetid ichor, exhaling the peculiarly
offensive stench of this disease. This pulpy, yellowish, putrid
substance becomes thicker, and extends deeply; it invades
the whole substance of a muscle, under which a probe may
be passed, and the instrument brought out through it, with
the loss, perhaps, of some striæ of blood, from parts which
are not yet actually destroyed; the mass is, however, adherent,
although its extent diminishes by the putrefaction and
wasting away of its surface.</p>

<p>There are two characters always peculiar to this disease,
in which it differs from all other gangrenous ulcers from
ordinary causes; these are, the circular form it assumes after
a very few days, even in its slighter varieties, and its peculiar
odor or stench.</p>

<p>167. If this disease were entirely a local complaint,
caused by the application of a morbid poison, giving rise to
the destructive changes described on the surface of an ulcer,
it should be followed by febrile or constitutional symptoms
at the end of several days only; and Delpech is disposed to
think that in such cases these constitutional symptoms take
place from and after the sixth day. If it were entirely a
constitutional disease, giving rise to the destructive changes
described as taking place on the surface of an ulcer, the
febrile symptoms should precede the changes in the ulcerated
surface. That the febrile symptoms do seem to follow the
appearance of the local alteration, is in many cases indisputable;
that they precede or accompany the local symptoms
in many other cases, is indubitable; and that the disease in a
mild state, although yet capable of committing much mischief,
is neither preceded nor followed by febrile or constitutional
symptoms, cannot be doubted. The febrile symptoms
themselves differ essentially from each other when they do
occur, generally partaking the character of the endemic fever
prevailing in the country at the season at which they appear.
The fever is sometimes inflammatory, sometimes typhoid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and occasionally resembles the bilious remittent of the summer
and autumn in hot climates, and ends in typhus. It is
probable that a want of attention to these circumstances decided
the opinions entertained by different individuals as to
the general character of the febrile symptoms, and of the
treatment to be pursued for their removal. That this disease
was generally considered a constitutional complaint, until
nearly the end of 1813, must be admitted; and it was the
very indifferent success which attended its treatment by constitutional
means and simple detergent applications, which
caused the surgeons of the British army to view it more as
a local disease, capable of giving rise to severe constitutional
symptoms&mdash;a change of opinion which was materially influenced
by the knowledge that the French surgeons more generally
considered, with Pouteau, that it was local in the first
instance, and treated it by the actual cautery. In my hands,
constitutional treatment, and every kind of simple mild detergent
applications, always failed, unless accompanied by
absolute separation, the utmost possible extent of ventilation,
and the greatest possible attention to cleanliness; and
not even then without great loss of parts in many instances.
This induced me, at Santander, in November and December,
1813, to try the mineral acids, not as then generally used as
stimulants or detersives, but as caustics. This proceeding
was always, however, accompanied by a constitutional treatment,
regulated by the nature of the symptoms, which at
that station were never benefited by bleeding, although it
had proved so effectual, without the local remedies, at the
neighboring sea-port of Bilbao.</p>

<p>168. Dr. Boggie, the great advocate for constitutional
treatment, says that under him, at Bilbao, in 1813, where
caustic applications were not used, or only as detersives, the
disease was arrested by blood-letting to the amount of one or
two pounds, and, in some cases, to the extent of three or four.
He admits, however, that bleeding must be resorted to with
the greatest caution in persons of less robust constitutions,
who may have lingered long in hospital, or suffered much
from ill health; and that in some cases it is altogether inadmissible&mdash;an
acknowledgment which is decisive, in my mind,
that constitutional treatment is only auxiliary. He says he
never saw the puncture made by the lancet affected by this
disease; a convincing proof to me, who have seen it, that
the virulence of the complaint, as an infectious disease, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
subsiding at Bilbao when the treatment he introduced proved
so effectual.</p>

<p>In one case at Santander, in which hospital gangrene in
the hand and arm and tetanus existed together, they were
both cured by venesection, which failed as signally in doing
the least good in a case in the next bed, under nearly similar
circumstances.</p>

<p>Dr. Boggie admits that “in that form of gangrene
named phagedena, a very great destruction of parts may
sometimes take place without the constitution being much
affected by it. Now, if blood-letting be used in such a case,
or even in the advanced stage of the true inflammatory gangrene,
when disorganization has taken place, and the system
is sinking under the consequent debility, the vital powers
being nearly exhausted, the result must be obvious; but
when it is used with caution, and in cases where it is really
applicable, it will be found to be a most valuable remedy.”
In all cases, Dr. Boggie, like every one else, had recourse to
emetics, purgatives, and such other general treatment as the
febrile symptoms appeared to indicate. As local applications,
he recommends cold water, alone or mixed with a small
portion of acetic acid, constantly applied and frequently renewed.
Poultices and warm applications he objects to; and
after the sloughs separate, he approves of dry lint and weak
solutions of sulphate of zinc. Should the sloughs adhere
after the inflammation has abated, warm, stimulating ointments,
and sometimes weak solutions of the nitrate of silver
or of the mineral and vegetable acids, may be had recourse to.</p>

<p>169. To Mr. Blackadder must be attributed the introduction
of the use of Fowler’s solution of arsenic as an escharotic,
in November, 1813, while he was at Passages; it
answered remarkably well in arresting the progress of the
disease, and was afterward found to be equally efficient in
the hospitals at Antwerp. The only objection to its use
that I am aware of is, that it caused in some few cases slight
symptoms of its poisonous effect having taken place on the
bowels, apparently from absorption,&mdash;an inconvenience
which might become a serious evil, and which caused a
preference to be given to the mineral acids, which act equally
well without incurring a similar risk of evil. Mr. Blackadder,
stationed on the same coast, within about forty miles of
Dr. Boggie at Bilbao, took a diametrically opposite view of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
this complaint to the doctor; and believing the disease to
be purely local in the first instance, considered venesection
as almost always unnecessary, although he admitted that
cases may occur in which the abstraction “of a small quantity
of blood would be likely to be attended with more good
than harm; but certainly,” he adds, “blood-letting is an
operation which ought to be avoided as much as possible in
gangrenous phagedena, particularly when the previous injury
has been extensive, such as that of a penetrating gunshot
wound.”</p>

<p>Dr. Walker, who served at Bilbao at the same time, concludes
an able report in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Lately, however, the disease put on a milder form, and
the sloughing did not proceed with that rapidity that it did
at first, nor was the fever so violent. And more lately still,
since the setting in of the cold weather, the type of the fever
seems to have changed entirely, and to have put on the inflammatory
type, so as to require strong evacuants, and even
bleeding, which has been used with the greatest success by
Staff-Surgeon Boggie, who has for a considerable time had
the more immediate care of the patients of this description
at the Cordeleria Hospital.”</p>

<p>170. “When this disease does not proceed rapidly, and is
confined to the ulcerative form,” Delpech says, “it may be
removed by stimulant applications, such as vinegar, the vegetable
and mineral acids, the Egyptian ointment, etc.” Of
these he prefers vinegar applied on lint, after having rubbed
or scraped off any false or pulpy membrane which appears
to conceal the surface of the ulcer. “Some good effect,” he
adds, “has been observed from the careful application of
powdered charcoal to the whole surface of the sore, which,”
he says, “ought not to be in the gangrenous, or pulpy, or
putrid state, but merely ulcerative or phagedenic; and not
even then, when this peculiar ulceration assumes a deeply
hollowed-out form, rapidly filled with an abundant and tenacious
discharge.” Of constitutional treatment he evidently
thinks little; and, while he admits the propriety and necessity
of treating every accompanying state of fever, whether
it be inflammatory, catarrhal, bilious, remittent, etc., by its
appropriate means, he does not seem to think they have
much influence on the local disease, although he firmly believes
that the suppression of the local disease materially
assists in arresting, in a great measure, such constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
symptoms as may be dependent on it, unless influenced by
some peculiarity of constitution. His principal local remedy
was the hot iron or actual cautery applied to every part.</p>

<p>He says (page 86) some surgeons of the Anglo-Portuguese
army of Lord Wellington had assured him that the
mineral acids, the hydrochloric, nitric, and sulphuric, had
been frequently employed in the British hospitals in Spain
with success; and he particularly mentions M. Guthrie, <i>Inspecteur
au Service de Santé</i>, as the person from whom he
especially received his information; thus establishing the
fact that the use of the mineral acids in a dilute and concentrated
state was known to, and had been essentially introduced
into practice by, the surgeons of the British army
during the war in Spain&mdash;a fact which admits of no dispute
as to the origin of its use.</p>

<p>171. In India, Mr. Taylor, late surgeon 29th Regiment,
now a deputy inspector-general in the medical department in
the Crimea, reports:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hospital gangrene appeared among the wounded of the
29th Regiment a little later than in the hospitals of other
corps. The disease declared itself, on the 18th of January,
in a stump case; and between that date and the 26th of the
same month fifteen cases had come under treatment. At
first I could tell, by the peculiar dark, florid countenance of
the patient, that his wound had taken on the gangrenous
affection; yet I cannot say that there was, in these cases,
any marked inflammatory fever. Subsequently, in the prevalence
of the disease, this dark-red color of the face was neither
well marked nor by any means so constant. In many
cases the disease seemed purely local; but in the great majority
there was certainly much feverish constitutional disturbance
accompanying the local affection, and often preceding
it. My experience of the disease, as it occurred among
the wounded at Ferozepore, does not enable me to determine,
satisfactorily to myself, whether it be essentially a local or a
constitutional affection. I am inclined to place it in the
former category; and there is no doubt whatever in my
mind that the essential means of treatment are local.</p>

<p>“In the treatment of this disease, I proceeded regularly
on one plan, and found that so efficacious that I was not inclined
to try any other. The plan adopted was, the application
of the strong nitric acid, so as completely to cut off
the diseased from the sound part, or part so far sound as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
only to be affected with inflammation. The acid, however,
required to be rubbed in with the blunt end of the probe, so
that it not only destroyed the cuticle, but killed the cutis
vera, and probably the cellular membrane underneath. The
narrow yellow ring of dead skin thus formed separated like
a piece of leather, generally carrying with it the whole
slough, and leaving a clean, healthy surface, as well as edges
to the wound. I never attempted to apply the acid to the
surface underneath the slough, neither is such an application
necessary; the vital seat of the disease is in its circumference,
however large the area. I must admit that the disease
sometimes crossed the acid boundary, and a second, and even
a third application of the remedy was required; but this was
rare. Neither was constitutional treatment neglected, but
this varied according to the state of the patient; emetics,
purgatives, saline medicines, and low diet being sometimes
required; while in other instances ether, ammonia, laudanum,
and generous diet were administered.</p>

<p>“When speaking of the symptoms of this disease, I should
have mentioned that a burning, gnawing sensation was sometimes
loudly complained of. The application of the acid
soon removed that pain, and the acid itself did not often
seem to produce much suffering. In one instance, deemed a
favorable one, I tried venesection, and I fear did mischief.
Calomel and antimonials were useful. I did not try the
arsenical solution. The change of air, which the march of
the wounded, on their return to Kussowlee, occasioned, certainly
had a very beneficial effect on all the gangrenous and
sloughing sores.</p>

<p>“At the same time that hospital gangrene was prevalent
at Ferozepore, some wounds took on a malignant fungous
affection, which spread over the healthy surface like the hospital
gangrene. The dirty, fibrous-looking, fungous growth
rose considerably above the edges of the wound, partially
overlapping them; these edges were inflamed, but not livid
and vesicated as in the cases of gangrene; but here also the
disease took the circular or oval form. The affection here
noticed I observed only in wounds of the forearm and hand;
Colonel Barr’s wound, which was of the forearm near the
wrist, took on this disease. The application of nitric acid
in the same way as for hospital gangrene eventually checked
its progress.</p>

<p>“In no case that came under my observation did the gan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>grene
directly prove fatal, though in many cases it contributed
largely in bringing about an unfavorable termination.”</p>

<p>172. <i>Conclusions.</i> First.&mdash;Hospital gangrene never
occurs in isolated cases of wounds.</p>

<p>Second.&mdash;It originates only in badly-ventilated hospitals,
crowded with wounded men, among and around whom cleanliness
has not been too well observed.</p>

<p>Third.&mdash;It is a morbid poison, remarkably contagious, and
is infectious through the medium of the atmosphere applied
to the wound or ulcer.</p>

<p>Fourth.&mdash;It is possibly infectious, acting constitutionally,
and producing great derangement of the system at large,
although it has not been satisfactorily proved that the constitutional
affection is capable of giving rise to local disease,
such as an ulcer; but if an ulcer should occur from accidental
or constitutional causes, it is always influenced by it when in
its concentrated form.</p>

<p>Fifth.&mdash;The application of the contagious matter gives
rise to a similar local disease, resembling and capable of propagating
itself, and is generally followed by constitutional
symptoms.</p>

<p>Sixth.&mdash;In crowded hospitals the constitutional symptoms
have been sometimes observed to precede, and frequently to
accompany, the appearance of the local disease.</p>

<p>Seventh.&mdash;The local disease attacks the cellular membrane
principally, and is readily propagated along it, laying bare
the muscular, arterial, nervous, and other structures, which
soon yield to its destructive properties.</p>

<p>Eighth.&mdash;The sloughing of the arteries is rarely attended
by healthy inflammation, filling up their canals by fibrin, or
by that gangrenous inflammation which attends on mortification
from ordinary causes, and alike obliterates their cavities.
The separation of the dead parts is, therefore, accompanied
by hemorrhage, which, when from large arteries, is
usually fatal.</p>

<p>Ninth.&mdash;The operation of placing a ligature on the artery
at a distance, or near the seat of mischief, does not succeed,
because the incision is soon attacked with the disease, unless
it has been arrested in the individual part first affected, and
the patient has been separated from all others suffering
from it.</p>

<p>Tenth.&mdash;The local disease is to be arrested by the appli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>cation
of the actual or potential cautery: an iron heated red
hot, or the mineral acids pure, or a solution of arsenic, or of
the chloride of zinc, or of some other caustic which shall
penetrate the sloughing parts, and destroy a thin layer of
the unaffected part beneath them. If a sinus or sinuses have
formed under the skin or between the muscles, from the extension
of disease in the cellular or areolar structure, they
must be laid open, and the cautery applied; for if any part
affected be left untouched or undestroyed by the acid, the
disease will recommence and spread from that point. The
parts touched by the acids or cautery may be defended by
cloths or other material, wetted with hot or cold water according
to the feelings of the sufferers, and poultices of various
kinds may be had recourse to, if unavoidable.</p>

<p>Eleventh.&mdash;After the diseased parts have been destroyed
by the actual or potential cautery, they cease in a great
measure to be contagious, and there is less chance of the
disease being propagated to persons having open wounds or
ulcerated surfaces. A number of wounded thus treated are
less likely to disseminate the disease than one person on
whom constitutional treatment alone has been tried.</p>

<p>Twelfth.&mdash;The pain and constitutional symptoms occasioned
by the disease, considered as distinct from the symptoms
which may be dependent on disease endemic in the
country, are all relieved, and sometimes entirely removed, by
the destruction of the diseased surface, which must, however,
be carefully and accurately followed, to whatever distance
and into whatever parts it may extend, if the salutary effect
of the remedies is to be obtained.</p>

<p>Thirteenth.&mdash;On the separation of the sloughs, the ulcerated
surfaces are to be treated according to the ordinary
principles of surgery. They cease to eliminate the contagious
principle, and do not require a specific treatment.</p>

<p>Fourteenth.&mdash;The constitutional or febrile symptoms,
whenever or at whatever time they occur, are to be treated
according to the nature of the fever they are supposed to
represent, and especially by emetics, purgatives, and the
early abstraction of blood if the fever be purely inflammatory,
and by less vigorous means if the fever prevailing in the
country be of a different character. Pain should be alleviated
by opium, which should be freely administered.</p>

<p>Fifteenth.&mdash;The essential preventive measures are separation,
cleanliness, and exposure to the open air,&mdash;the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
steps toward that cure which cauterization will afterward in
general accomplish.</p>

<p>Sixteenth.&mdash;If the sufferer be very young, or of a weakly
habit, his strength will frequently require to be supported
in the most efficient manner by a due administration of
cinchona bark, wine, and a generous diet,&mdash;means often
found essentially necessary after all severe attacks of debilitating
diseases.</p>

<p>The formidable nature of this terrible disease, before the
local application of caustic remedies was fully adopted, will
be best understood by the following document.</p>

<p>173. The efforts resorted to by nature for the suppression
of serious hemorrhages depend on the capabilities of the
arteries as resulting from their structure, into which it becomes
an object of importance minutely to inquire. With
this view, the old division of an artery into three coats may
be continued, the difference between ancient and modern
anatomy being in their subdivision into different textures
or layers. The annexed diagram shows the edge of a large
artery, which has been divided circularly, and magnified so
as to exhibit six layers in a distinct manner; each of the
three ancient coats is divided into two. The <i>inner</i> or old
serous coat is shown to be separable into <i>two</i>: the epithelial,
marked 1, and the fenestrated, marked 2. The <i>middle</i> coat
is also separated into <i>two</i>: the inner, or <i>muscular</i>, marked
3, and the outer, or <i>elastic</i>, marked 4. The <i>outer</i> coat is
divisible also into two layers, the <i>inner</i>, marked 5, and the
<i>outer</i>, marked 6; number 5 being composed more of elastic
fibers: number 6 more of areolar fibers, by which tissue, in
a less condensed state, the arteries of the extremities are
attached to their sheaths. Such may be considered to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
the general composition of a large artery, each particular
structure remaining to be examined.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i-177" style="max-width: 30em;">

</div>

<p>174. If a small portion of the inner coat of an artery be
gently scraped with a knife, or if the inside of the cheek be
treated in a similar manner, a little white soft substance is
brought away on it, called <i>epithelium</i>, a name given to it by
Ruysch, from the delicate layer of epidermis investing the
female nipple, έπι, upon, θηλή, <i>a nipple</i>. The epithelium of
the human body is divided into three kinds by microscopists&mdash;the
<i>tesselated</i>, <i>pavement</i>, or <i>scaly</i>; the <i>cylindrical</i>, or
<i>conical</i>; and the <i>spheroidal</i>, or <i>glandular</i>. The tesselated,
as it exists in arteries, is represented in diagram No. 1, in
three different stages&mdash;in the young person, in middle age,
and in the very old person; one stage gradually degenerating
or changing into the other, at each different period of
life. It is composed of a single layer of nucleated cells, of
a flat, oval, round, hexagonal, or polygonal form, and about
1/1400 of an inch in diameter, the nucleus in each cell containing
within itself one or more nucleoli, and even several
paler granules. The epithelium has a thickness proportioned
to the friction or pressure to which it is exposed,
particularly when covering the skin. In the arteries of the
young, and in the mammalia generally, the epithelium is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
strongly marked; in older persons, all traces both of cells
and nuclei have disappeared. It lines not only the internal
surface of the arteries and veins, but the mouth with its
mucous glands; the <i>conjunctiva</i> of the eye; the pharynx
and œsophagus; the vagina and cervix uteri; the entrance
of the female urethra, and the serous membranes.</p>

<p>The <i>conical</i> or cylindrical is composed of cells closely
set together, of a conical, cylindrical, or pyramidal form,
about 1/1200 of an inch long, each cell inclosing a flat nucleus,
with nucleoli. It lines the urethra in the female, from the
entrance where the tesselated ends, and extends inward to
the urinary tubules of the kidneys; the greater part of the
male organs in a similar manner; the digestive canal and
gland-ducts, from the cardia to the anus.</p>

<p>The <i>spheroidal</i> or <i>glandular</i> epithelium consists of cells,
more or less circular or spherical in figure, each having a
large nucleus in its center. The epithelium is met with in
all glandular organs, such as the liver, kidney, lachrymal, and
salivary glands, and in these cells the proper secretion of
the gland is developed. The tesselated and cylindrical kinds
are, on the contrary, more or less protective.</p>

<p>The two first kinds are sometimes ciliated, by the addition,
at their free extremities, of several fine, pellucid, blunt, and
pliant hairlike processes or cilia, about 1/5000 of an inch
long, which are, during life, in constant motion. This kind
of epithelium, known as the ciliary, lines the whole respiratory
track of mucous membrane; the <i>palpebral</i> conjunctiva,
as opposed to the tesselated on the eyeball; the ventricles
of the brain; the posterior half of the uterus, and the
Fallopian tubes.</p>

<p>The epithelium is placed upon the second layer of the
internal coat, which, from certain appearances of apertures
or windows, has been called the <i>perforated</i> or <i>fenestrated</i>
layer. (See diagram No. 2.) It can be peeled off in small
pieces only, and shows under a power of 250 diameters a
series of well-marked fibers running in almost parallel lines
upon a comparatively structureless membrane, resembling
the inner layer of the cornea, as in the left-hand figure of
the diagram, the fibers being arranged in the length of the
vessel. They frequently bifurcate, and almost immediately
join again, so that an oval space, resembling a hole, is perceived.
This is not always a hole or perforation, as it is
generally described to be, as may be seen and proved by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
fact that the supposed opening is sometimes filled up by
small bodies, like nuclei, as if the oval space were occupied
by a cell. This fenestrated layer varies in thickness in
different vessels, and is more strongly developed in the lower
animals than in man; by some authorities it is not regarded
as a distinct layer, but as the innermost layer of longitudinal
fibers belonging to the middle coat. When this layer is
very thick, the fibers which are yellow do not all run in the
direction of the length of the vessel, for others crossing at
right angles may sometimes be observed, as delineated in
the right-hand figure of diagram No. 2. These two layers
compose the ancient inner coat of an artery, and are frequently
the seat of disease.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp97" id="i-179" style="max-width: 30em;">
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">No. 2.</p></div>
  <img class="w100" src="images/i-179.jpg" alt="Epithelium." />

</div>

<p>The middle coat, as it was termed, forms by much the
greatest part of the thickness of an artery, and, generally
speaking, is of a more or less yellow color. It appears
fibrous to the naked eye, and can be peeled off not unfrequently
in a series of circular layers; when examined microscopically,
it is seen to be composed of <i>two</i> sets of fibers
arranged in a circular direction. The inner layer is composed
principally of muscular fibers, of the organic or
involuntary kind. (See line marked 3 on the circular diagram.)
The outer layer, marked line 4 on the same diagram,
is made up chiefly of elastic fibers, with a much smaller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
amount of the muscular or contractile element. These conjoined
layers form the muscular coat of Mr. Hunter, the
fibrous or contractile coat of later anatomists, who denied
its muscularity from the supposed absence of fibrin&mdash;an
error fallen into from chemical science being unequal at that
time to its discovery, or rather of its more elementary part,
called <i>protein</i>, the principal constituent both of albumen and
fibrin, which two are now found to differ from each other
in the addition only of three per cent, of sulphur. Mülder
says, in his “Animal and Vegetable Chemistry,” (Part II.
p. 307:) “The combinations of sulpho-phospho protein
(<i>fibrin</i> and <i>albumen</i>) and of sulpho-protein <i>casein</i> with
acids, alkalies, and salts are especially remarkable. Protein
is soluble in weak alkalies. Since, therefore, the serum of
the blood is always slightly alkaline, being a proteate of
soda, with sulphur and phosphorus, it keeps the sulpho-phospho
protein in solution. This property is the cause of
the blood remaining in a liquid state&mdash;a chief requisite for
animal life.</p>

<p>“If a weak alkaline solution of protein be neutralized
by an acid, the solubility of sulpho-phospho protein is
greatly diminished. The sulphuric and phosphoric acids,
by not dissolving protein, stanch bleeding. Acetic acid,
by which protein is dissolved, does not, neither does the
hydrochloric.</p>

<p>“Protein, according to Mülder&mdash;although it is doubted
by Liebig&mdash;is a complex substance, consisting of several
heterogeneous organic compounds united into one whole,
easily acted upon by strong reagents.</p>

<p>“If a protein compound be brought into contact with an
alkali, ammonia is immediately disengaged, and the alkaline
solution can hardly be made weak enough to prevent the
disengagement of ammonia. If either fibrin or coagulated
albumen be dissolved in a weak potash lye, ammonia is
always perceptible. Protein, therefore, is always in a state
of decomposition, as serum is alkaline.”</p>

<p>In diagram No. 3, fig. 3, the organic or <i>involuntary</i>
muscular fibers of the intestine are shown, consisting of more
or less flattened bands, the fibers of which are soft, and
marked with minute granules, sometimes exhibiting traces of
nuclei. These purely muscular fibers are most abundant
next to the inner coat of the artery, and diminish in number
as they approach the outer layer, their place being occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
by firmer and more elastic fibers of a yellow color, seen collectively
in the circular diagram, as line 4, and separately in
diagram 3, fig. 4, and in diagram 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp55" id="i-181" style="max-width: 30em;">

</div>

<p>The <i>involuntary</i>
muscular fibers of an
artery do not always
form a continuous
layer; they are often
smaller than those
found in the intestines,
bladder, and
uterus, and occur as
fusiform cells, detached
from each
other, and having a
large, club-shaped
nucleus, as shown at
fig. 6 in diagram 3.</p>

<p>The <i>voluntary</i>
muscular fibers differ
from the <i>involuntary</i>,
in having cylindrical
fibers of much
larger size, with transverse
and longitudinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
markings, unlike the flattened fibers of less size of the involuntary
muscles, which have also a faintly granular appearance,
instead of the more determined transverse and
longitudinal lines of the voluntary muscles.</p>

<p>The <i>outer</i> or <i>elastic</i> layer of the ancient <i>middle</i> coat,
represented by line 4 in the circular diagram, contains muscular
fibers, but it is formed principally of strong, elastic
fibers difficult of separation, and, when torn across, have
curled extremities, as shown in the diagram marked 4, differing
only in size from those found in the ligaments of the
spine, and in the ligamentum nuchæ of quadrupeds, as shown
in the separate diagram marked 4.</p>

<p>The <i>external</i> coat of an artery, divided also into <i>two</i>
layers, is shown on the circular diagram by lines 5 and 6.
These two layers are composed of the yellow elastic fibers
last noticed, and another set of fibers, <i>white</i> in color and <i>in</i>elastic
in structure, arranged in various directions; the <i>inner</i>
layer predominating in yellow elastic, the outer layer in
white inelastic fibers, constituting a firm investment to all
the other layers of which the artery is composed. The white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
inelastic fibers are shown in diagram No. 3, fig. 5, with a
yellow elastic fiber curling round them. The constant crossing
and recrossing of these two sets of fibers form certain
spaces, which, when not in a compact form, become real
spaces, meshes, or areolæ, constituting what is now called
areolar tissue, rather than the cellular of the older anatomists,
from the circumstance that the areolæ communicate,
and that perfect cells in any tissue do not. These elements
of areolar tissue can be readily distinguished by the action
of acetic acid, under which reagent the white fibers will
almost disappear, leaving only a slight trace of fibers containing
oval nuclei, as seen and marked in diagram 3, fig. 5.
It is seen when unraveled in <i>b</i>, diagram 5.</p>

<p>The inner layer of the middle coat, or muscular coat, as
it may be justly termed, forms, it will be seen, the greatest
part of the thickness of the wall of certain arteries, and in
some instances, as in the anterior tibial artery, constitutes
nearly the entire thickness of the vessel. The <i>internal</i> coat
in all is frequently seen puckered in a longitudinal direction.</p>

<p>175. The arteries are supplied with blood by vessels of
small size, which do not come off immediately from the part
of the artery they are destined to supply, but principally
from neighboring vessels. They are called vasa vasorum.
They are arranged precisely in the same manner as those of
the areolar tissue. A few of these vessels penetrate as far
as the middle or muscular coat, but do not reach the inner,
which has no vessels, proximity to the circulating fluid
being apparently sufficient for its nutrition.</p>

<p>Arteries are supplied with nervous influence by branches
from the sympathetic system running in their walls, and
through their connection by ganglions with the organs they
supply with blood.</p>

<p>176. The cells, nuclei, and nucleoli alluded to are supposed
to be thus produced. In a shapeless, consistent,
sometimes almost gelatinous mass, to which the name of
<i>cyto</i>-blastema or <i>formative substance</i> has been given, containing
the materials requisite for the production of cells,
small, round grains or nucleoli are perceived in the act of
formation. Around these grains a layer of granular matter
is deposited, which continually increases in thickness, and
constitutes the kernel or nucleus. This is oval shaped or
round, almost always opaque, has a granular surface, and is
considered to be a vesicle, a little cell itself. From the
sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>face
of this kernel a small, very thin transparent vesicle is
raised, appearing as a segment of a sphere, which soon expands,
and becomes so large, when full grown, that the kernel
lies as a minute corpuscle upon its interior wall; the
material for its formation being supplied by the cyto-blastema,
it is converted into a vesicle by the kernel which is
first formed, its embryo existing in the formative substance.</p>

<p>The first trace of organization is the production of a
small, perceptible body, or nucleolus, which deposits on the
surface a granular substance from the cyto-blastema, to give
rise to a little producing organ, the kernel or nucleus. This
further transforms the surrounding cyto-blastema into a
granular surface, from which the vesicle is formed, raised,
expanded, and filled with a liquid, in which vesicle thus
enlarged the kernel remains inclosed and adhering to a
certain spot of its wall.</p>

<p>If two nucleoli lie close to one another, they coalesce and
become one solid mass, capable of producing one cell only,
containing one kernel and two nucleoli. This view is that
of Schleiden and Schwann, supported by Mülder, but not
entirely approved by Henle; inasmuch as no kernel can be
perceived in the cells of many cellular systems while in the
act of formation. In the elementary parts of animals which
have long since lost their cellular form, the remnants of
kernels are frequently found, as has been demonstrated in
the preceding diagrams. The manner, however, in which
the elementary first-seen granules are formed in the cyto-blastema,
science has not yet been able to discover. The
chemists have proved that all elementary organic substances
consist of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, susceptible
of endless modifications of their respective forces, under
which an organic molecule or ovum is produced, and after
that, under certain circumstances, an animal such as man.</p>

<p>177. When the current of blood through the main trunk
of the arteries of an extremity is cut off, the circulation is
carried on by the collateral branches. This collateral circulation
is more perfect, more active in young persons during
the increase or growth of the body, than it is either at
maturity or in the decline of life. The important point is
not, however, alone referable to the time of life at which the
continuity and permeability of the main trunk cease to exist,
but to the nature of the disease or injury which has given
rise to it.</p>

<p>When an aneurismal limb has been injected, on which an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
operation has not been performed, the collateral vessels have
all been found larger and more fully shown than on the opposite
side, although not to the same extent as in cases of a
similar nature in which the operation has been done.</p>

<p>It is necessary that this enlargement of the collateral
branches should lake place at an early period, because in
many cases of aneurism the artery beyond or below the
tumor is obliterated long before any operation is performed.
The main supply of blood has been already cut off from the
extremity, and the operation adds very little to the derangement
of the circulation which has for some time taken place
below the tumor.</p>

<p>When an operation has been successfully performed for
aneurism, and the patient has died some time afterward,
dissection has shown various arteries enlarged, both above
and below the part where the trunk was obliterated by the
ligature; and not only an enlargement of arteries, which,
from their regularity have received names, but others have
been developed not usually known to exist, or not of a size
to be conveniently traced. These through their frequent
anastomoses bring the blood at last into several large trunks,
by which it is again conveyed to the original vessel below
all and every obstruction which may have taken place; thus
compensating by a circuitous route for the loss of the direct
supply. The principal object of inquiry is, do these vessels
always exist, or at what period of time do they begin to
enlarge, so as to enable them to carry on the circulation, in
the manner in which it is presumed to be done?&mdash;for few
will assert that the enlargement of these particular collateral
vessels was an accidental play of nature, and existed previously
to the commencement of the disease or injury for
which the operation was performed. On this point, the
theory of the operation for aneurism and its applicability to
wounded arteries appears to hinge; and, what is of more
importance, on which the practice resulting from it depends.</p>

<p>Two distinct kinds of collateral circulation are at present
acknowledged: one by direct large communicating arteries;
the other through the direct medium of the capillary vessels
inosculating with each other. Where direct communicating
arteries exist, little subsequent change beyond enlargement
takes place in them. It is otherwise with the indirect
capillary vessels. When the radial or ulnar artery has
been divided in the hand, the blood will not only flow readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
from each end of the divided vessel, but equally red and
arterial from both, the communication being through direct
arterial branches from one vessel to the other. It will also
be red and arterial if the division take place at the wrist,
and may be so in the brachial; but if the femoral in the
lower part of the thigh be wounded, the color of the blood
issuing from the lower end of the artery, if any issue at all,
will be <i>dark or venous</i>. It is so, because it has been
obtained from the capillary arteries, which in this case being
empty received blood by regurgitation from the veins, the
valves of which when present do not prevent its reflux
course. If a limb be injected and carefully dissected four
or five days after a ligature has been placed during life high
up on the principal trunk, the capillary vessels will be seen
to be well injected; but few or none will be found large
enough to admit of their inosculation being traced throughout.
If another limb be injected and dissected, some sixty
days after the ligature has been applied, a difference will be
distinctly observed between the two preparations. In the
latter, the capillaries will not appear to be so fully injected,
but several larger and more tortuous vessels will be found
in situations where they were not expected to exist; and
the anastomoses of these one with another, generally by
arches, may be traced to their communication with the principal
trunk, both above and below the obliterated part. If
an incision were made in the nearest pervious portion of the
lower part of an artery in the thigh of a person who had
undergone this operation, arterial blood would issue from it.
The communication would have become direct by communicating
branches, and the capillaries would have returned to
their accustomed duties.</p>

<p>178. During the first twenty-four hours after the division
of an artery such as the femoral, or the application of a
ligature, the temperature of the limb is commonly diminished;
after that period, and as the action of increase takes place,
the temperature is usually from three to five degrees higher
than in the opposite healthy limb. At the end of from
eighteen to twenty-eight days, in a successful case, it is
found to be equal in both.</p>

<p>It is asserted by some sanguine supporters of the all-powerful
influence of the collateral circulation, that it is
sufficient at all times, and under all natural circumstances,
to maintain the life of the extremity. The practice of the
Peninsular war proved the fallacy of this opinion in too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
many instances to admit of any doubt of its inadequacy to
do so in the lower extremity after the division of the femoral
artery, under ordinary circumstances. The fact of enlargement
or of a new development of vessels having taken place
after the commencement of disease or the reception of an
injury, has been demonstrated by dissection, and it is through
them the life of the limb is to be preserved; but time is
required for their development. When a limb is lost through
mortification, as the consequence of a division or obstruction
of the principal artery, it usually takes place after the infliction
of a sudden injury, in consequence of these collateral
branches not having had time to enlarge.</p>

<p>179. The collateral circulation is therefore not the same,
and is not in the same stage of preparation, in a limb suffering
from a divided or wounded artery, as in one in which an
aneurism has for some time existed; this is the reason why
mortification is more common after wounded arteries than
after operations for aneurism.</p>

<p class="h2sub">PROPER TREATMENT OF WOUNDED ARTERIES, ETC.</p>

<p>180. The due appreciation of the means adopted by nature
and by art for the suppression of hemorrhage, as well
as the proper treatment of wounded arteries, is owing to the
surgery of the war in the Peninsula. They were suspected
after the battles of Roliça, Vimiera, Oporto, and Talavera,
but did not receive their complete development until after
the battle of Albuhera. It was not until after that of Toulouse
they were partially admitted; and it is only of late
that they have been almost everywhere acknowledged,
taught, and practiced.</p>

<p>Previously to the time of Mr. Hunter, the diseased or dilated
state of the coats of an artery which constitutes an
aneurism was, when it occurred in the ham, very often fatal.
The operation of Anel, first performed in 1710, of cutting
down to the artery, and placing a ligature upon it immediately
above the dilated part, was not approved, and Mr.
Pott, the great contemporary of Mr. Hunter, recommended
in bad cases that amputation should be resorted to in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
first instance; although Desault had succeeded, in 1783, in
a case of popliteal aneurism, in which, after the manner of
Anel, he had placed the ligature on the artery a little above
the aneurismal swelling in the ham. Mr. Hunter’s contemplative
mind, aided by his knowledge of anatomy and of disease,
led him to believe that the ligature thus applied on the
artery in the ham failed, because the vessel was unsound at
that part, and was therefore incapable of taking on those
healthy actions necessary for the obliteration of its canal
above the ligature, which are known to take place when the
artery is in a normal state. He concluded that this was sufficient
to account for the failures, without especially taking
into consideration the difficulty of applying the ligature in
the ham immediately above the aneurismal sac, and of the
probability of the sac suppurating when thus molested; an
occurrence aiding materially in the necessity for the loss of
the limb by amputation, performed then under circumstances
of constitutional irritation, which would render it less likely
to be attended with success.</p>

<p>From the consideration of these and other circumstances,
Mr. Hunter was induced to propose, in 1785, that the ligature
should not be placed on the artery near the tumor in the
ham, but at a greater distance on the fore part or middle of
the thigh, and Scarpa subsequently recommended it to be
placed even higher&mdash;a recommendation which has been generally
followed, and the spot now selected for this operation
is at the lower part of the upper third of the thigh. This
operation was therefore performed not only for aneurism,
but improperly for a wound of the artery, not only in the
ham, but even in the leg; it consequently failed in almost
every instance of traumatic injury, thus rendering amputation
necessary, which was generally followed by death.</p>

<p>181. The Hunterian theory implies:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the artery is in general sound at the part in the
front of the thigh selected for operation, while it is usually
unsound in the popliteal space behind, or in the ham, where
Desault operated, and Anel recommended it to be done; that
operation is now abandoned on the continents of Europe and
America, as well as in England.</p>

<p>2. That a ligature can readily be placed upon it at a distance
from the disease in the fore part of the thigh, and will
usually be followed by success as far as concerns the obliteration
of the artery immediately below the part on which it
is applied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
3. That the artery being aneurismal, the collateral
branches had begun to enlarge, so as to be better able to
carry on the circulation, after the supply of blood to the
lower part of the limb by the main trunk had been cut off.</p>

<p>4. That no branches of importance are usually given off
between the ligature on the artery on the fore part of the
thigh and the sac of the aneurism in the ham.</p>

<p>5. That if such branches were ever given off, and brought
the blood from their collateral communications back into the
main artery below the ligature, and thence into the sac, so as
to renew its pulsatory movements, they would ultimately disappear,
from the impelling force not being sufficient to prevent
a gradual coagulation taking place, which would soon
fill up the cavity of the sac, and thus prevent its further enlargement;
at which stationary point a process of removal
by absorption would begin and continue, until the diseased
sac with its contents had diminished, if not entirely disappeared,
leaving only a trace behind of its former existence,
the process thus described being frequently assisted by a
commencing obliteration of the artery immediately below the
aneurism. The essential point in this theory, which has immortalized
the name of Hunter in surgery, depends on the
integrity of the aneurismal sac, which ultimately retains, as
a general rule, subject to rare exceptions, any blood which
may be brought into it, either by the collateral branches
from above, or from below by what may be called regurgitation,
until it has become coagulated, when the sac is so filled
up that no more blood can pass into it to cause its further
distention, or any ulterior evil.</p>

<p>This theory of Mr. Hunter, then so new, so beautiful in
itself, was eagerly embraced by nearly all the civilized world;
and surgeons were not content with applying it to cases of
diseased or aneurismal arteries, to which it is especially applicable,
but they extended it indiscriminately to cases of
wounded arteries, to which the practice of the war in Spain
proved it was inapplicable, and in which I have, since 1811,
maintained it could only succeed as a matter of <i>accident</i>, not
of principle.</p>

<p>182. The essential features of the theory opposed to Mr.
Hunter, with respect to wounded arteries, and called mine,
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That the artery at the wounded part is free from previous
disease, and may be expected to take on those healthy
actions which, after the application of a ligature, lead to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
obliteration of its canal, and the consequent suppression of
hemorrhage.</p>

<p>2d. That the circulation of the blood by the collateral
branches is less free in a sound limb than in one which has
suffered during several weeks from the formation of an
aneurism.</p>

<p>3d. That this freedom of circulation is less in the <i>lower</i>
than in the <i>upper</i> extremity, under all circumstances.</p>

<p>4th. That mortification of the foot and leg, and often of
the whole limb, followed by the death of the person, is a
common occurrence after a ligature has been placed high up
on the artery in the thigh, in consequence of a wound; while
it is not so common an occurrence when such operation is
performed in the same place for an aneurism of several weeks’
duration. If the vein be also wounded, mortification is
almost inevitable.</p>

<p>5th. That mortification of the hand and arm rarely
follows the application of a ligature to the artery of the
<i>upper</i> extremity in any part of its course, however near the
heart.</p>

<p>6th. That when the collateral vessels are capable of carrying
on the circulation through the lower extremity, the
<i>lower</i> end of the divided artery bleeds <i>dark</i> or <i>venous</i>-colored
blood, while its <i>upper</i> end bleeds <i>scarlet</i> or <i>arterial</i>-colored
blood. In the upper extremity, the color of the blood
from the lower end of the divided artery is little altered&mdash;a
consequence of the greater freedom of anastomosis, or of the
freer collateral circulation in the upper extremity. Facts of
the greatest importance in surgery.</p>

<p>7th. That whenever the collateral vessels are not capable
of carrying on the circulation of a limb, mortification or
death of the part ensues; and <i>that whenever this collateral
circulation is sufficient to maintain the life of the limb,
blood must pass into the artery below the wound, and
must, as a general rule, pass up and out through the
lower end of the divided artery, unless prevented by the
application of a ligature, or by some accidental circumstance,
forming an exception to the rule, but not the rule
itself</i>.</p>

<p>8th. That the collateral branches are capable of bringing
blood into the artery above the aneurismal sac and between
it and the ligature, is admitted in the Hunterian theory,
which blood the aneurismal sac receives, and usually retains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
When the artery is a wounded artery, and the ligature is
applied at a distance above the wound, blood is often brought
into it below the ligature in a similar manner; but as there
is <i>no aneurismal sac</i> to receive and retain it, the patient
bleeds perhaps to death, unless surgery come to his assistance.</p>

<p>9th. The presence of an aneurismal sac in one case, and
its absence in the other, is the essential difference destructive
of the Hunterian theory for the treatment of aneurism being
applicable to that of wounded arteries.</p>

<p>10th. The processes for the natural suppression of hemorrhage
are somewhat different in the upper and lower ends of
an artery, and are less capable of resistance in the lower.
This end frequently yields to the pressure of the blood regurgitating
from below, and renews a bleeding which may
have been suppressed for weeks, unless its closure has been
rendered more permanent by the application of a ligature.</p>

<p>11th. The absence of the aneurismal sac renders the application
of two ligatures absolutely necessary, one on each
end of a divided artery, or one above and one below the
wound, if the artery should not be divided; constituting the
most essential feature of my theory, and the principal point
to be attended to in the treatment of wounded arteries.</p>

<p>12th. This bleeding from the lower end of the vessel,
which is more or less of a venous color, and issues in a continuous
stream, may be restrained by compression properly
made on the course of the lower part of the wounded artery;
but in no instance should recourse be had to a ligature on a
distant part of the artery above the seat of injury, until
every other possible effort to arrest the hemorrhage from the
lower end of the vessel has failed.</p>

<p>13th. The great principles of surgery to be observed in
cases of wounded arteries, and which ought never to be
absent from the mind of the surgeon, are two in number:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That no operation ought to be performed on a wounded
artery unless it bleed.</p>

<p>2. That no operation is to be done for a wounded artery
in the first instance but at the spot injured, unless such operation
not only appears to be, but is impracticable.</p>

<p>183. The means adopted by nature for the suppression of
hemorrhage have been investigated by Celsus, Rufus, Galen,
Œtius, etc., down to Dr. Jones, the most important English
writer on this subject; but the methods of inquiry they all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
adopted appear to have been insufficient and unequal to the
object in view. They bled an animal until he died, and then
reasoned on the manner or means by which the bleeding was
suppressed, when it was in fact arrested by death. It is obvious,
then, that it is only when nature has not been interfered
with, and the patient has not died from bleeding continued
to the last moment, but has, on the contrary, lived some time
after the hemorrhage has ceased, that the processes by which
its suppression has been accomplished can be fairly investigated.
These processes essentially depend on the size and
variations of structure in an artery, which have been shown
to be dissimilar in large and small arteries, and not even
quite alike in the upper and lower ends of the same artery&mdash;facts
which were elicited from observations made on men on
the field of battle during the Peninsular war, and consequently
not liable to error. It was then proved that arteries
of moderate dimensions, such as the middle part of the femoral
or the axillary, tibial or brachial, and particularly all
below these in size, are capable, by their own intrinsic
powers, when completely divided, of arresting the passage of
the blood through them without any assistance from art, or
from the surrounding parts in which they are situated. The
establishment of this fact overthrew at once the theory which
relates to the importance of, and necessity for, the sheath of
the vessel, and the offices it performs in suppressing hemorrhage
in vessels of this size, and in a great measure that
supposed to be derived from the formation of an external
coagulum, the <i>bouchon</i> of the French.</p>

<p>184. When the femoral artery has been fairly divided in
the lower part of the thigh, the patient has, in almost all the
cases which have come under observation, either died without
assistance, or the hemorrhage has ceased spontaneously.
Having been thus arrested for twelve hours, the efforts of
nature are usually sufficient to prevent its return from the
<i>upper</i>, although not from the <i>lower</i> end of the vessel; but
then it is of <i>venous</i> and not of <i>arterial</i> color&mdash;a fact I first
demonstrated, and which is now acknowledged to be of the
greatest importance. The great evil to be dreaded in such
cases is not from hemorrhage from the <i>upper</i> end of the
divided artery, but from the <i>lower</i>, and from <i>mortification
of the foot</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>upper</i> end of an artery retracts on being divided, and
this retraction is accompanied by a contraction of the cut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
extremity of the vessel, which assumes the shape of the neck
of a French wine-bottle or Florence oil-flask. The contraction
is confined in the first instance to its very extremity, so
that the barrier opposing the flow of blood is formed by this
part alone. The contraction, however, goes on increasing
for the space of an inch; it is usually filled up with an internal
coagulum of a round, pyramidal shape, adhering firmly
to the contracted end of the artery, loose at its apex, and
extending frequently as far as the first collateral branch, but
rarely under any circumstances beyond two inches; the very
orifice of the artery on the outside being in a few days
covered by a layer of a yellowish green-colored substance or
fibrin, which indicates its situation in a remarkable manner.
Some of these processes are continued even after the external
wound has healed; the artery generally goes on
diminishing and contracting as far as it is useless, so that of
three or four inches, from one to two may be impervious, the
remainder being contracted, although still permeable by a
probe. An accompanying nerve, where there is one, would
do the reverse, the cut extremity would become enlarged or
bulbous, gradually diminishing as it is traced upward, until
it regains its proper size.</p>

<p>The processes adopted by nature for closing the lower end
of a divided artery of the size of the femoral at the inferior
part of the thigh are somewhat different from those employed
at the upper or opposite extremity. The retraction
or contraction of the <i>lower</i> end of a divided artery is neither
so perfect nor so permanent as at its <i>upper</i> end, and the
small internal coagulum is in many instances altogether wanting,
or very defective in its formation. The closure of the
lower orifice being less perfectly accomplished than of the
upper, it is the more likely to suffer from secondary hemorrhage,
which may be distinguished from that from the upper
end of the artery at an early period after the accident, by
the <i>venous color of the blood, and from its flowing or
welling out in a continuous stream, as water rises from a
spring, and not with an arterial impulse</i>.</p>

<p>The retracting and contracting powers in the lower end
of a divided artery are nevertheless considerable, and are
sufficient in some cases to nearly close the lower end of the
femoral artery when divided by amputation above the knee.
When the femoral artery is cut across, the lower portion of
the vessel is emptied by its last efforts, combined with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
action of the capillaries. When the collateral circulation is
powerful, blood soon regurgitates into the artery, but the
force of the regurgitation can be in no proportion to that of
the propulsion at the other or <i>upper</i> divided end of the
vessel, which will generally be able to resist this impulse,
while the <i>lower</i> one often opens and bleeds after the lapse
of a few days. In all the cases I have had an opportunity
of examining, in which hemorrhage had taken place from
the lower end of the artery, the following appearances were
observable after the interval of from four to five days.</p>

<p>The same kind of yellowish-green matter marks and conceals
the situation of the lower extremity of the artery in
the wound as it does the upper. It is, however, thinner where
it immediately covers the end of the artery, which in none
of these cases was contracted in the conical manner described
as taking place in the upper extremity. On the introduction
of a probe with the greatest gentleness into the artery from
below, it usually makes its appearance at a point on the
yellow space, raising a thin portion as it protrudes. On
laying open the artery, the orifice would seem to have been
once closed by this layer of fibrin, but with a less degree of
contraction than the upper end of the same artery; the layer
still, however, forming an obstacle sufficient to cover and
close three-fourths of the orifice, the blood having flowed
through the remaining fourth, which had probably given
way by accident; which accident is usually some sudden or
continued motion being given to the extremity or part injured,
and which motion it is imperatively necessary to avoid,
when the lower end of a wounded artery has not been secured
by ligature.</p>

<p>A soldier, who had his arm carried away by the bursting
of a shell at the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo, was brought to
me shortly afterward. The axillary artery, becoming
brachial, was torn across, and hung down lower than the
other divided parts, pulsating to its very extremity.
Pressed and squeezed in every way between my fingers in
order to make it bleed, it still resisted every attempt,
although apparently by the narrowest possible barrier,
which appeared to be at the end of the artery, and formed
by its contraction. The orifice of the canal was marked by
a small red point, to which a very slight and thin layer of
coagulum adhered, the removal of which had no influence
on the resistance offered by the very extremity of the artery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to the passage of blood through it. In this, and in another
instance of a similar nature, the end of the artery being cut
off at less than an eighth of an inch from the extremity, it
bled with its usual vigor. In both, the vessel for near that
distance was contracted so as to leave little or no canal at
its orifice, which in these cases was filled by a coagulum of
the size and shape of a very small pin.</p>

<p>Mr. Deputy Inspector-General Taylor informs me that
a soldier of the 44th Regiment was struck by a cannon-shot
on the 21st of June, 1855, in front of Sebastopol; it carried
his left arm away from the shoulder, leaving the artery, vein,
and nerves exposed as in the accompanying sketch. The
thought, he says, crossed my mind, as I held the artery between
my finger and thumb, that it might be for the benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of the patient to place a ligature on the artery at the highest
point, exposed, cutting off the part below, having had a
precisely similar case at Ferozeshah, in India, in which the
soldier recovered without the artery being tied, or any
hemorrhage recurring. The shot, in carrying away his arm,
struck him very severely on the chest, and I fear has injured
the lungs, but there is so much ecchymosis that the presence
or absence of sounds cannot be distinguished by the
stethoscope. Of this injury of the chest the man died
some days after its receipt. The body was buried without
examination, but no hemorrhage had taken place from the
wound.</p>

<p>Private J. Barnes, 29th Regiment, on the 16th of May,
1811, at the battle of Albuhera, received a musket-ball in
the right thigh, behind and above the knee, inclining downward
and inward, close to the condyles of the femur, and in
the direction of the femoral artery becoming popliteal; it
bled violently at the moment, and so continued for a few
minutes, during which time he conceives he lost two quarts
of blood. It then ceased, and he was dressed in the usual
slight manner, and remained two days upon the field of battle,
until removed to Valverde, nine miles, on a bad road, on
men’s shoulders, in a blanket converted into a bearer. He
was considered as one of the slighter cases, until the gentleman
in immediate charge of him requested me to see him,
on account of his toes being in a state of mortification.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 3d of June, eighteen days after the
accident, the man was placed on a bullock car, to be removed
with the rest of the wounded to Elvas, the mortification of
the foot having ceased to increase, and a line of separation
having been formed. Shortly after the cars moved, I was
informed that he was bleeding from the wound: it evidently
appeared to flow from the popliteal artery; and as it issued
slowly, I supposed from the lower divided end. The foot
being partly lost, I determined on amputation above the
knee, which was performed at Olivença. The amputated
limb was sent after me to Elvas, that it might be examined
at leisure. I carefully traced the course of the wound, and
found in it a little coagulated blood, but could not see the
mouth of the vessel. A probe passed into the upper end
of the artery was obstructed before it reached the ulcerated
surface by nearly an inch; and on passing it up the lower
one, it was stopped exactly in the middle of the track of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
ball, by a veil or substance drawn across the mouth of the
vessel, which, on careful examination, showed the point of
the probe at one part of the circle, although too small to let
it through; from this part I conceive the hemorrhage came.
The divided ends were one inch apart. The <i>upper</i>, or
femoral portion, for nearly an inch, contained a firm coagulum,
filling up that part of the artery, which had contracted
like the neck of a claret bottle. The <i>lower</i> or popliteal
portion of the artery had a very peculiar appearance; the
substance drawn across appeared to have closed it completely
at one time, and to have given way from the rough
motion of the car at the point now open, which was very
small even when the sides of the artery were approximated.
A very little soft coagulum was behind it; and if the man
had not been removed, the vessel might have remained
secure. This case shows very distinctly the means adopted
by nature for the suppression of hemorrhage from both ends
of a divided artery.</p>

<p>Corporal Carter, of the pioneers of the 29th Regiment,
was wounded at the battle of Roliça, in August, 1809, by a
musket-ball, which passed through the anterior and upper
part of the forearm, fracturing the ulna. Shortly afterward
a profuse hemorrhage took place, and the staff-surgeon in
charge tied the brachial artery. In the night the hemorrhage
recurred, and the man nearly bled to death. The
arm was then amputated, when the ulnar artery was found
in an open and sloughing state.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;A simple incision to expose the wounded
artery, and placing two ligatures upon it, would have saved
this man his arm and his life.</p>

<p>At the battle of Vimiera, which followed a few days
afterward, a soldier received a somewhat similar wound,
save that the brachial artery bled forthwith, the hemorrhage
being stopped by the tourniquet. Warned by the preceding
case, I cut down on the artery, carefully avoiding the nerve,
which had been tied in the former instance, and found the
artery more than half divided. It was secured by a ligature
above and below the wound: the bleeding did not afterward
return, and the man recovered.</p>

<p>185. Thomas Carryan, of the 3d Regiment, was wounded
at Albuhera, on the 16th of May, 1811, on the inside of the
calf of the right leg, the ball passing out on the fore and outside
of the tibia: it bled considerably for some minutes, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it ceased, and the hemorrhage did not return until the 15th
of June, on which day a little blood followed the dressings,
and increased on the patient making any exertion; so that
on the 4th, the gentleman under whose care he was tied the
femoral artery on the outside of the sartorius muscle, which
suppressed the hemorrhage for that day, the limb continuing
with little or no interruption of the same temperature to the
hand as the other. On the 5th, the original wound had a
bad appearance, and some coagulated blood was readily
pressed out of it; on the 6th, a greater quantity came away;
and on the 7th, the exertion of using the bed-pan was followed
by a stream of arterial blood, which ceased on tightening
the precautionary tourniquet.</p>

<p>The limb was amputated above the ligature on the artery.
Its dissection showed the anterior tibial artery to have been
destroyed for some distance, and the muscles on the back
part of the leg nearly in a gangrenous state. The patient
died a few days afterward.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;If an incision had been made in the leg so as
to expose the artery, and ligatures had been placed on it
above and below the wound, the man, in all probability,
would not have died.</p>

<p>Sergeant William Lillie, of the 62d Regiment, aged thirty-two,
was wounded in the right thigh, on the 10th of April,
at the battle of Toulouse, by a musket-ball, which passed
through, in an oblique direction downward and inward,
close to the bone, describing a track of seven inches. The
ball was extracted behind on the field. He said he had bled
a good deal on the receipt of the injury, which he had stopped
by binding his sash round the limb. The discharge from the
wound was considerable; it appeared, however, to be going
on well until the 20th of the month, when, on making a sudden
turn in bed, dark-colored blood flowed from both orifices
of the wound in considerable quantity. I had given an order,
as the Deputy Inspector-General in charge of all the wounded,
that no operation should be performed on a wounded artery
without a report being sent to me, and an hour at least
granted for a reply, unless the case were of too urgent a
nature to admit of it. It appeared to be so in this instance,
and before I arrived Mr. Dease had performed the operation
for aneurism at the lower part of the upper third of the
thigh. I could only express my regret that it had been
done, and point out the probability of the recurrence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
hemorrhage from the lower end of the artery, which took
place on the 7th of May, when the limb was amputated, and
the man subsequently died. On examination the artery was
found to have been divided exactly where it passes between
the tendon of the triceps and the bone. The upper portion
of the artery thus cut across was closed. A probe introduced
into it from above would not come out at the face of
the wound, although the impulse given to this part on moving
it was observable in the middle of a large, yellowish-green
spot, which I had previously declared to be the situation
of the extremity of the artery which had contracted
behind this, in the shape of a claret bottle, for about an inch,
having within it a small coagulum. The lower end of the
artery from which the hemorrhage had taken place was
marked by a spot of a similar character; but on passing a
probe upward from the popliteal space, it came out at a
very small hole in the extremity of the artery, in the center
of the yellow spot, the canal of the artery not being contracted
and diminished, but only apparently closed by a
layer of the yellowish-green matter laid over it, and adhering
to its circumference.</p>

<p>Sergeant Baptiste Pontheit, of the French 64th Regiment,
was wounded by a musket-ball at the battle of Albuhera, on
the upper and fore part of the thigh; it passed out behind,
in the direction of the femoral artery. He lost a great quantity
of blood before the hemorrhage ceased, but the wound
went on well until the 26th, ten days after the battle, when
he felt something give way in his thigh, and found himself
bleeding from the wound, which, however, soon ceased on
pressing his hand upon it. In the afternoon, on again moving,
he lost about half a pint of florid blood, which induced
the surgeon on duty to place a tourniquet on the limb.
When at leisure (in the course of two hours) I removed the
tourniquet, and as no hemorrhage occurred, and there was
no swelling in the vicinity of the wound, I replaced the
dressing with a precautionary screw tourniquet, explaining
to him its use, and the probable nature of his wound, together
with the operation requisite to be performed in case of further
bleeding.</p>

<p>On turning in bed at night he lost a little more blood,
which ceased on his tightening the tourniquet, which was
shortly after loosened. In the morning, everything being removed,
there appeared some swelling about the wound, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
opening of which was filled up by a coagulum: gentle pressure
being made, it readily turned out, and was followed by a
stream of arterial blood, leaving little doubt of the femoral
artery being wounded. Compression being effected in the
groin, I made an incision three inches and a half in length,
taking the wound as a central point, and exposed the femoral
artery and vein: both were wounded, the former being half
destroyed in its circumference, surrounded with coagulated
blood, and appearing as if it had sloughed from being
touched by the ball, the course of which was directly past it,
and would have carried it away if it had not been for the
elasticity of the artery. A ligature placed above, and another
below the wound, secured both artery and vein; the incised
wound was brought together by adhesive plaster, and the
limb placed in a relaxed position. The operation was of
short duration; he lost little or no blood, but, the circulation
was very languid, and the man exceedingly low. The
warmth of the leg and foot was soon below the standard of
the other; warm flannels were applied, and some brandy
was given to him. In the evening the heat was more natural,
and the man returned thanks for the humanity and kindness
shown to him, congratulating himself and me upon the
success of an operation which he had supposed would be
infinitely more severe. The next morning he ate a tolerable
breakfast, but felt a pricking sensation in the calf of the leg,
which was as warm to the hand as the other, but the foot
was cold. The second day the swelling of the limb, its appearance,
and discoloration on the under part, indicated
approaching mortification, which on the third was evident,
and on the fourth, at mid-day, he died, the limb up to the
wound being nearly all in a gangrenous state. No adhesion
had taken place in the wound, or in the artery, which showed
the inner coat cut, the ligatures being firm, and no coagulum
behind them.</p>

<p>Captain St. Pol, of the 7th or Royal Fusiliers, was wounded
in the ham from behind, while in the ditch at the foot of the
great breach at Badajos. He fell instantly, and lost, as he
thinks, a considerable quantity of blood. On recovering he
was raised from the ground, and walked a few paces prior
to his being carried to his tent, where I saw him in the afternoon
of the next day, the 7th. The leg had ceased to bleed
before his arrival in camp. A substance could be felt on the
inner side of the patella, which, by the sensation
communi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>cated
to the finger on moving, appeared to be the ball, which
was extracted. Some dark-colored blood issued from the
cavity; the ball was lying loose and unconnected; the finger,
on being passed into the joint, which was swollen, discovered
no splinters of bone, and the entrance of the ball
behind would not admit the finger. His having walked some
distance on the leg, and the absence of any splinters between
the articulating extremities of the bones, induced Dr. Armstrong,
the surgeon of his regiment, and myself to think that
the ball had entered with little injury to the bone; and after
stating to the patient the little hope we had of ultimately
saving the limb, independently of the great danger to which
he was exposed, compared to the certainty of the operation
of amputation at the moment, we recommended its being
done, but he would not consent. The next day he was
removed to Badajos on a litter, the heat of the tent being
unsupportable.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 9th I saw him early, when the want
of circulation in the foot was evident from its having lost its
natural color and warmth; the knee was swollen, but not painful,
and I had no doubt that the artery had been divided by
the ball. The marbled appearance and tallow-white color
soon indicated the loss of the leg above the calf; and vesications
had formed on the foot, already of a green color.</p>

<p>On the 12th, the extent of the gangrene was defined on
the back of the knee up to the original wound at its lower
edge, gradually receding as it advanced to the fore part of
the leg, which for three inches below the knee was apparently
sound; the uneasiness of the knee being moderate,
and the incised wound looking perfectly healthy, although
the latter had not united.</p>

<p>On the 16th, the separation of the dead from the living
parts having taken place behind, and being well marked and
commencing on the fore part, the limb was amputated as
low down as possible. Sixteen vessels were tied; the parts
were gently brought together, without any hope of union.
According to subsequent experience, this operation should
not have been performed. The dead parts only should have
been removed, and the stump left to nature until the health
was perfectly restored.</p>

<p>On the 24th he died.</p>

<p>On examining the amputated limb, the popliteal nerve
was found untouched, the ball having passed on the inside;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the popliteal vein was also entire, having a small tumor adhering
to its under part between it and the artery, the divided
end of which was closed by a yellowish-green firm substance
readily distinguishing it from the surrounding parts. On
clearing the whole from the bone, and making a small circular
opening into the tumor, which was elastic and covered
with brown fibrous layers, it proved to be an aneurismal sac,
smooth on the inside, containing florid arterial blood and
some little coagula. The artery, on being carefully opened
to the closed end, appeared to have been injured above the
part divided by the ball, and communicated with the sac by
a small fissure or rupture. The end of the artery was then
slit up, so as to show the very little thickness of the closing
substance and the great original contraction of the diameter
of the vessel. There was no internal coagulum, neither was
there any laid over the external part of the artery; between
it and the bone there was a coagulum about the size of a
small phial cork. The other end of the artery could not be
found, from the gangrenous state of the parts.</p>

<p>Private P. Turnbull, of the grenadiers of the 74th Regiment,
of good stature, was wounded on the 10th of April,
1814, at Toulouse, by a musket-ball passing from the inside
to the outside of the middle of the thigh; he says it bled
considerably at first, but the bleeding soon ceased; the wound
was not painful, and he thinks he observed the leg and foot
to be colder than the rest of his body for the first two or
three days, but did not much attend to it, further than conceiving
the numbness, coldness, and impeded power of motion
as natural to the wound.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April, the gentleman in charge of this
patient pointed him out to me as an extraordinary case of
gangrene coming on without, as he supposed, any sufficient
cause. The wound on the outside of the thigh, or the exit
of the ball, was nearly healed, and that on the inside was
without inflammation or tumefaction, and with merely a little
hardness to be felt on pressure. The pulsation of the artery
could be distinctly felt to the edge of the wound, but not
below it; the leg was warm, the gangrene confined to the
toes. The artery of the other thigh could be distinctly
traced down to the tendon of the triceps. As he was at a
small hospital, about two miles from town, on the field of
battle, I did not see him again until the 20th, and afterward
on the 23d, when, although the gangrenous portion included
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
all the toes, it had the appearance of having ceased. Satisfied
that it would again extend, I left directions with the
assistant-surgeon that the limb should be amputated <i>below
the knee</i>.</p>

<p>The surgeon, whom I had not seen, and who did not understand
the subject, disobeyed the order, conceiving that
there must be some mistake. On visiting the hospital, a
little after daylight on the 25th, I was greatly annoyed at
finding that the operation had not been done, and that the
mortification had begun to spread the evening before. It
was then too late. On the 26th it was above the ankle, with
considerable swelling up to the knee. At night the man
died; and the next morning, at six o’clock, I removed the
femoral artery from Poupart’s ligament to its passage through
the triceps, which part was affected by the mortification.</p>

<p>The ball had passed between the artery and vein in the
spot where the vein is nearly situated behind it and adherent
only by cellular membrane, through which the ball made its
passage, the coats of the vein being little injured, and those
of the artery not destroyed in substance, although bruised;
it was at this spot much contracted in size, and filled above
and below by coagula, which prevented the transmission of
blood, and the vein above and below the wound was filled
by a coagulum and was also impassable. This preparation
is unique; it is perhaps the only one in existence proving
the elasticity which vessels possess, and their capability of
avoiding to a certain extent an injury about to be inflicted
upon them. It is in the museum at Chatham.</p>

<p>186. When a round and small ligature is properly applied
to an artery of a large size, such as the femoral, the sides of
the vessel are brought together in a folded, plaited, or wrinkled
manner; the ancient inner and middle coats of the artery,
including the modern four, are divided, while the outer
one remains entire and apparently unhurt. If the ligature
be removed, an impression or indentation made by it on the
outer coat will remain as a mark; and if the artery be slit
open in a careful manner, the division of the inner coats will
be obvious. These changes were known to Desault, and are
mentioned by Deschamps in his work on the Ligature of
Arteries. They were more satisfactorily proved to occur by
Dr. Jones, and have been clearly stated by Mr. Hodgson
and others. The remaining part of the process differs from
the account they have given, and, according to observations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
I have had opportunities of making on the living and on the
dead, is as follows: the inner and middle coats, formed by
four distinct layers or structures, are not only divided, but
the inner ones particularly appear to be curled inward on
themselves, so that the cut edge of one half or side is not
applied to its fellow in the usual way of two surfaces, but
by curling inward meets its opponent on every point of a
circle, and in this way forms a barrier inside that of the external
coat, which is tied around it by the ligature; so that,
in fact, when a small ligature is firmly tied, its direct pressure
is not applied to the inner coats, which have been divided
and have curled away from it, but to the two layers
of the outer coat, which are in consequence of that pressure
made to ulcerate or slough&mdash;processes which could scarcely
fail to take place also in the other coats if they were subjected
to pressure in a similar manner. The cut edges of
the four inner layers being from this provision of nature
perfectly free, are capable of taking on the process of inflammation,
which stops at the adhesive stage. This they
do by the effusion of lymph or fibrin both within and without,
to a greater or less extent as the case may require. The
outer coat of the artery must either yield by ulceration or
sloughing, or the ligature must remain until it is decomposed
and destroyed. It usually yields by sloughing, in consequence
of its being deprived of life by the pressure of the
ligature, which is left at liberty by the ulceration which takes
place in the sound part of the artery immediately above and
below the part strangulated, which part is frequently brought
away in the noose. The artery does not always yield by
sloughing, particularly if it be a large one and the ligature
thick and soft. In this case, a part of the outer coat, and
particularly the white, inelastic substance, from its folding or
plaiting under the ligature, seems to escape that degree of
pressure necessary to destroy it; and when the remaining
part yields, it continues entire, and is only removed by a subsequent
process of ulceration occasioned by its irritation as
an extraneous body.</p>

<p>In such cases, the layers of the external coat could not
close around the inner ones, which are thus shown to be capable
of forming an effectual barrier without it, although it
materially assists in giving greater strength to the cicatrix,
by the effusion of fibrin which takes place within, without,
and around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
While this process is going on without, and at the very
extremity of the artery, the vessel is gradually contracted
above it, and its coats become more or less inflamed, soft,
and vascular. The inner layers are seen to be wrinkled
transversely, and a small coagulum of blood is formed
within them. This sometimes completely fills the artery,
but it is more common for a small, tapering coagulum to
be formed, adhering by its base to the extremity of the
vessel; the white color of which renders it distinctly observable,
when contrasted either with the coagulum or the
inner coat of the artery, which latter is usually of a red
or scarlet color while the inflammatory action is going on.
A coagulum, contrary to the usually received opinion, is
not absolutely necessary to the permanent closure of the
artery, although it certainly assists in maintaining it. An
artery is also supposed to contract gradually up to its first
collateral branch; but this is not always the case, and
depends entirely on the use for which the branch is required.
After amputation at the middle of the arm, the
artery will go on diminishing in size up to the subscapular
branch, the circumflex arteries diminishing in proportion,
in consequence of their being so much less necessary than
before the operation. In several instances the principal
artery has remained pervious below the collateral branch,
the next immediately above the part where the ligature
has been applied. Neither will the presence of a collateral
branch immediately above where the ligature has been
placed upon the artery always, although it sometimes may,
interfere with the consolidation of the wound, and the
closure of the canal of the vessel. It may impede the
process, and render it for a time less safe, and in some instances
it may prevent it altogether, but I have so often
seen large arteries, heal after division close to the giving
off of a considerable branch, that I consider them to be
always capable of doing so, provided they are naturally
sound. If they are not sound, it is very doubtful what
process may take place; but it will be less likely to be a
healthy one, if interfered with by the immediate proximity
of a collateral branch. The power which suppresses hemorrhage
in a bleeding artery resides, it must be borne in mind,
in the very extremity of the vessel itself. It is, however,
advisable to take care that a ligature shall be applied above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
rather than immediately below a branch given off from a
trunk, more particularly when it may be doubted whether
the trunk is free from disease.</p>

<p>In 1834 I placed a ligature of strong dentists’ silk on
the right common iliac artery of a lady of middle age for
a swelling in the hip, supposed to be a gluteal aneurism,
which, after commencing the operation, was found to occupy
a considerable part of the iliac region. The lady died a
year afterward, and it was then found that the ligature had
been applied at the distance of five-eighths of an inch from
the bifurcation of the aorta, and three-eighths of an inch
above the origin of the internal iliac, independently of the
line of separation between the parts of the iliac divided by
the ligature, which did not seem to be wider than the ligature
itself. The separated ends were united at the point of
separation by new matter, the orifice or end of each being
closed by a very narrow barrier, the inner coat of the artery
being redder than natural, somewhat irregular and contracted,
and containing hardly any coagulum. <i>The fact
was thus proved in the largest artery in the body save one,
that a coagulum is not necessary for the safety of the
union, while the immediate vicinity of so large a vessel as
the internal iliac, to say nothing of the aorta itself, also
proves that the danger hitherto expected from the neighborhood
of a collateral branch is more imaginary than
real</i>&mdash;two great facts the practice of the Peninsular war led
me to declare, and which ought no longer to be doubted.</p>

<p>The preparation exemplifying these points is in the museum
of the Royal College of Surgeons, together with the ligature
still carrying in its noose the portion of the artery it strangulated
and brought away with it.</p>

<p>187. A ligature should always be round and small, provided
it be sufficiently strong. The strength of a ligature
is variously estimated; some surgeons trying it by the
strength of their own fingers, others by what they conceive
to be the resisting power of the coats of the artery, in which
perhaps they may err. The only way in which a surgeon
can hope to acquire correct information on this point is by
trying on the dead body what force of fingers is required to
cut the inner coats of arteries of various sizes; and then
taking the least force required for this purpose, to ascertain
whether he can easily pull the ligature over or off the
divided end of the artery. If a surgeon will take the trouble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to do this, he will find that he has estimated the necessary
force much too highly, and that he is in more danger of
breaking his ligature than of failing to secure the artery.
Hemorrhage has, however, been known to occur from the
ligature having slipped off the end of an artery, which had
been divided in the operation for aneurism, although I have
never seen it happen after amputation, where the vessels
were tied with a small, firm ligature. It constitutes a valid
objection to the division of the artery between the ligatures,
when two are applied.</p>

<p>A ligature composed of one strong thread of dentists’
silk, well waxed, is sufficiently firm for the largest artery.
It does not, however, much signify what may be the shape,
size, form, or substance of ligatures, when they are applied
to arteries in a sound state, provided they are not too large,
are fairly and separately tied, and with a sufficient degree of
force to retain the ligature in its situation until separated
by the usual processes of nature, which generally take from
fourteen to thirty days for their completion.</p>

<p>188. When arteries are unhealthy, the selection and
proper application of a ligature are points of great importance.
A larger although yet a small, round ligature
should be fairly, evenly, and firmly, although not so forcibly
applied as on a sound artery; without the intervention of
any substance whatever between it and the cellular covering
of the vessel. The secondary hemorrhages which are recorded
by different writers as prone to occur, and which did
take place, happened, I am disposed to believe, more from
the application of improper ligatures than from any other
cause; for the inner coat of an artery is so prone to take on
the adhesive state of inflammation that if a strong, small
ligature be applied in the manner directed, it is more than
probable that the closure of the artery will be effected.
Ulceration will, however, sometimes take place on the inner
coat of the vessel, and slowly extend outward, undoing in
its progress any steps which may have been begun for the
consolidation of the extremity of the artery. When a
secondary hemorrhage does occur from this or from any
other cause, it is usually from the beginning of the second
to the fourth week; but there is no security for the patient
until after the ligature has come away, unless it is retained
an inordinate length of time, from having included some
substances which do not readily yield under irritation, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as the extremity of a nerve, or a slip of ligament which is
not sufficiently compressed in the noose of the ligature.</p>

<p>Secondary hemorrhage may also take place from the
extension of ulceration or sloughing to the artery from
the surrounding parts, and perhaps as frequently as from
any other cause; but when mortification occurs, there is no
secondary hemorrhage, unless in that species which is called
hospital gangrene. The advantages to be derived from the
application of a strong, small ligature, from the least possible
disturbance of the surrounding parts, and from absolute
quietude, while the healing processes are going on, must be
so obvious as to require no further observation. An undue
interference with the ligature, by pulling at it, cannot be too
earnestly deprecated at an early period; although, at a subsequent
time, some force is occasionally required for its
removal after amputation.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE FEMORAL ARTERY, ETC.</p>

<p>189. When the femoral artery is <i>cut across</i> in the upper
part of the thigh, whether it be done by a cannon-shot, a
musket-ball, or a knife, the patient does not always bleed to
death at once, although he frequently dies after a time in
consequence of the shock and the loss of blood.</p>

<p>At the battle of Toulouse a large shot struck an officer
and two men immediately behind him, and nearly tore off
the right thigh of each. The artery was divided about, or
less than three inches below Poupart’s ligament. I saw the
officer shortly afterward, in consequence of his surgeon
saying it was a case for amputation at the hip-joint. The
bleeding had ceased, the pulse was feeble; the countenance
ghastly, bedewed with a cold sweat, and with every indication
of approaching dissolution. The house being at an
advanced point, and close to one of the French redoubts,
the fire of round shot and musketry was so severe upon and
around it as to induce me to remain, until the battery should
be taken by the troops then advancing upon our flank. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
order to occupy my time usefully, I returned to the officer,
and found he had just expired. Desirous of seeing by what
means the hemorrhage had been arrested, I cut down upon
the artery, took it carefully out, and found that its divided
end was irregularly torn; a slight contraction had taken
place just above, but not sufficient to have been of the
slightest utility in suppressing the bleeding, which was in
fact prevented by an external coagulum, which filled up the
ragged extremity of the vessel, and which in a few days, if
he had lived, would have been removed with the purulent
discharge, an internal one forming in the mean time, the extremity
of the artery also contracting and retracting, so that
a secondary hemorrhage might not have taken place, indeed
would not in the generality of instances.</p>

<p>At Salamanca I had the opportunity of examining the
thigh of a French soldier, whose femoral artery had been
divided perhaps even higher up by a cannon-shot. He lived
until the next morning, when I saw him, no operation whatever
having been attempted, nor a tourniquet applied. He
died exhausted, but not from any immediate bleeding, which,
when once stopped, had not returned. The artery was in a
similar state to the preceding one, with this slight difference,
that the orifice was a little more contracted; the external
coagulum filled up the ragged end of the artery, and was
slightly compressed within by the contraction, which kept it
in its place. The rest of the coagulum filled the hollow in
the surrounding parts, which the retraction of the artery had
occasioned. In this case, so unlike those I have hitherto
noticed, the first natural cause giving rise to the suppression
of the bleeding was the diminution of the power of the
heart; the second, the formation of a coagulum in the
hollow of the sheath left by the retraction of the artery.
Contraction had begun, but had done nothing essential.
(See <i>Aph.</i> 413.)</p>

<p>In other instances in which I have examined the extremities
of such large arteries when divided, the appearances
have been more or less of a similar nature; unless where
the persons had died immediately, when the torn extremities
were found quite open, with little surrounding coagulum. I
have, however, seen persons wounded in this manner live for
several days, when I have found, after death, the extremity
of the artery open, and no appearance of blood having passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
into it below Poupart’s ligament. The consent necessary
between the inner coat of the artery and the blood for the
free passage of blood had been destroyed by the injury.</p>

<p>190. A <i>small puncture</i> in an artery, made with a needle,
will sometimes heal, as it generally does in dogs. I have,
however, seen several instances in which the femoral artery
was wounded by a tenaculum, during amputation, and a
secondary hemorrhage followed, requiring the application of
a ligature. A <i>larger puncture</i>, or a longitudinal slit of
from one to two lines in extent, does not commonly unite,
except under pressure, although the edges of the wound
may not always separate so as to allow blood to issue in
any quantity. It sometimes only oozes out, and occasionally
does not do even that, unless some obstacle to the circulation
takes place below, when blood is propelled with a jet; and
the edges of the cut having thus been separated, blood continues
to be thrown forth in considerable quantity. In an
artery of the size of the temporal, a small longitudinal slit
may sometimes heal without the canal of the artery being
obliterated, although this very rarely takes place in one of a
large calibre.</p>

<p>In all cases of punctured wounds, when pressure can be
effectually made, and especially against a bone, it should be
tried in a graduated manner over the part injured, in the
course of the artery above and below the wound, and if in
an extremity, over the whole limb generally, the motions of
which should be effectually prevented, and absolute rest
enjoined, if the artery is of any importance. This should
be continued for two, three, or more weeks, according to
the nature of the injury.</p>

<p>A medical student, being desirous of bleeding his friend,
also a student, in the arm, opened the ulnar artery, which in
this case was very superficial. On discovering the error he
had committed, he closed the wound, and applied a firm
compress and bandage, under which it healed. On applying
the ear to the part, it sounded like an aneurism, although
there was scarcely any tumor, the thrilling sound being apparently
occasioned by friction against the cut edges of the
artery. This thrilling noise diminished, and the vessel immediately
below the wound gradually recovered its pulsation,
except at the exact situation of the injury, where none could
be distinguished. It was obliterated at that part for the
length of the eighth of an inch.</p>

The master tailor of the 40th Regiment, tempted by the
approaching prospect of plunder, was induced, on the night
of the assault on Badajos, to give up the shears, and arm
himself with the halbert, and was properly rewarded for his
temerity by a wound from a pike in the right arm, from
which, he says, he bled like a pig, and became very faint.
On his arrival at the spot indicated for surgical assistance,
he fainted; but this was attributed to the unwarlike propensities
of the man, rather than to any sufficient cause.
The wound was not more than one-third of an inch long, a
little below the edge of the pectoralis major, and immediately
over the artery. The arm and hand were numb and
cold; the pulse was not distinguishable at the wrist, and it
appeared to cease at the place of injury, which was harder
and a little more swollen than natural. He said that his
pulse had always been felt by the doctors in the usual place.
The wound healed without any trouble. On the 1st of May
the pulsation of the artery could be felt a little below the
wound. On any exertion he had a good deal of unpleasant
numbness in the thumb and forefinger. A small cicatrix
formed at the place of the wound, which was otherwise quite
natural to the touch. This case proves that when a large
artery is wounded in man by a sharp cutting instrument, to
a certain but moderate extent the process of cure takes
place through inflammation and by the obliteration of that
part of the canal of the vessel. Continental surgeons have
since sacrificed whole hecatombs of animals to prove this
fact, which had been so many years before recorded in
England as having occurred in man.</p>

<p>It has not been satisfactorily proved in man that a large
artery, such as the femoral or even the brachial, has been
opened to the extent of one-third or a fourth of its circumference,
and that the wound has healed without the canal
becoming impervious. A <i>smaller wound</i> of a large artery
may close without obstructing the canal of the vessel, but
the part is not so firm or so solid as before, and may yield,
and give rise to an aneurism, having apparently the characters
of a small true, as opposed to the spurious diffused,
or even circumscribed swelling, which more usually follows
a similar accident.</p>

<p>Colonel Fane was wounded by an arrow in the right side
of the neck, opposite the bifurcation of the carotid, which
caused a considerable loss of blood at the moment. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
wound healed, leaving only a mark where the point of the
arrow had entered. Some time afterward he observed a
small swelling at the part, which, from its pulsation, was declared
to be an aneurism. Uneasy about it, he asked my
opinion at Badajos, after the siege. It had not increased,
but it caused him some anxiety, and I promised to place a
ligature on the common carotid if the aneurism should increase
in size. He was unfortunately killed in action a year
afterward, by a shot through the head.</p>

<p>191. When a large artery, such as the brachial, is cut
<i>transversely</i> to a fourth of its circumference in man, it
forms a circular opening as in animals; and if the artery be
large, the bleeding usually continues until the person faints,
or it is arrested by pressure. In dogs the bleeding commonly
ceases without any assistance from art, and without the
animal being exhausted; in horses and sheep the bleeding
usually continues till the animals die; while in man, even
with the best aid from compression, hemorrhage will in all
probability recur, unless the circulation be altogether arrested.
If the external opening only should be closed, a spurious,
circumscribed aneurism will be the consequence in so small
an artery as the temporal, and a ligature will sometimes be
required above and below a little aneurism of this description.
In a larger artery the spurious aneurism may or may
not be diffused.</p>

<p>When an artery of this size is <i>completely divided</i>, it is
less likely to continue to bleed than if it had been only
wounded. When it is merely cut or torn half through, but
not completely divided in the first instance, it is in the same
state with regard to hemorrhage as if it had partially given
way by ulceration. It can neither retract nor contract, and
will continue to bleed until it destroys the patient, unless
pressure be accurately applied and maintained until further
assistance can be procured. The practice to be pursued is
to divide the vessel, if it be a small one, such as the temporal
artery, when it will be enabled to retract and contract; and
the bleeding will in general permanently cease under pressure,
especially when it can be applied against the bone. If
the artery is of a larger class, and continues to bleed, it
should be sufficiently exposed by enlarging the wound; a
ligature should be applied above and below the opening in
the vessel, which may or may not be divided between them
at the pleasure of the surgeon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
In June, 1829, I happened to be at Windsor, on a visit
to my old friend, the late Dr. Ferguson, and was called to a
young gentleman, the upper part of whose right femoral
artery had been accidentally cut by the point of a scythe.
On dilating the wound, a tourniquet being on the limb, black
blood flowed freely from it; on unscrewing the tourniquet
by degrees, arterial blood showed itself, and the upper end
of the artery was secured by ligature when the tourniquet
was removed. Venous-looking or black blood then again
flowed in greater abundance than before, evidently from a
large vessel. This I restrained by pressure made below the
wound with the thumb of the left hand, while I laid bare the
lower part of the artery, from a slit in which, near an inch
in length, the black blood was seen to flow. A ligature
passed around the vessel below the wound suppressed the
bleeding. The artery was not divided, and the young gentleman
perfectly recovered, and has continued well until this
day. The absolute necessity for two ligatures was here well
shown, as well as the flow of dark-colored blood from the
lower end of the artery. This gentleman is now an officer
in the army, and suffers no inconvenience from his accident.</p>

<p>192. When a large artery is wounded at some depth
from the surface, and the external opening is small, blood
not only issues through the opening, but is often forced into
the cellular structure of the limb to a considerable distance;
the pulsation of the tumor is observable, and the thrill or
sound which accompanies a ruptured artery is distinct. If a
large quantity of blood, partly in a fluid, partly in a coagulated
state, be collected immediately over and around the
wound in the artery, the tumor may not pulsate or give forth
any sound, if the coagulated blood be in considerable quantity,
although some elevation of the tumor may be observed
corresponding to the pulse.</p>

<p>This rising or pulsation of the swelling often depends on
the impulse given to the whole, as a mass, by the artery
against which it is lying, and not upon blood circulating
through it. An impulse of this kind is distinguishable in
a bronchocele which lies immediately over and in contact
with the carotid artery. It is the same when blood is extravasated
by the rupture of several small vessels, in consequence
of the passage of a wheel over the limb, especially
in the thigh, where a swelling containing fluid blood will
sometimes pulsate in a well-marked manner, until it gradu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>ally
diminishes as the blood coagulates, when the motion
becomes a mere elevation at each stroke of the heart. The
whizzing sound or thrill attendant on a ruptured artery is in
these cases wanting, being a very diagnostic mark of this
accident; although where there is true aneurism, and it has
burst, forming a diffused and spurious one, the thrill may be
wanting; but the history of these cases enables a surgeon to
distinguish between them. If several ounces of blood are
thrown out, and remain fluid, they ought to be evacuated, or
suppuration will ensue. If they become coagulated, the
mass will be gradually absorbed. Fluid blood should be
evacuated by a small opening, and the part afterward treated
by compress and bandage. If the fluid or partly coagulated
blood should increase in quantity, and the swelling continue
to enlarge and pulsate, the extension of the mischief should
be arrested by opening the swelling and securing the artery
by ligature. When the external opening is enlarged, and
the clots which filled it up are at all disturbed, arterial blood
begins to flow, and the finger will readily follow the track
through which it passes down to the artery, if it should not
be too far distant. If the incision be made sufficiently large
to enable the operator to remove these clots of blood with
rapidity, the finger will more readily pass down to the wound
in the artery, which, if a large one, may be thus easily discovered,
if within reach and sight, provided the tourniquet
be thoroughly unscrewed, and the surgeon is not afraid. A
ligature should then be placed above and below the opening
in the artery.</p>

<p>When an artery is wounded, and the external opening in
the integument heals so as to prevent the blood from issuing
through it, a traumatic, spurious, circumscribed, or diffused
aneurism is said to form, according to the facility which is
offered by the structure of the parts for the confinement or
diffusion of the extravasated blood. A traumatic aneurismal
tumor of this nature differs essentially from aneurism which
has taken place as a consequence of disease, and not of direct
injury. If a spurious aneurism form from disease, the artery
is in general unsound for some distance above and below the
tumor. In the aneurismal tumor from a wound, the artery
is perfectly sound, except as far as concerns the seat of injury.
There is, then, not only a great and essential difference
between these two kinds of aneurism as regards their
nature, but also with respect to the collateral circulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and the operation to be performed for their cure; and the
surgeon may not overlook these facts.</p>

<p>A school-boy, about fourteen years of age, let a pen-knife
drop from his hand while sitting down, and drew his knees
suddenly toward each other to catch the falling knife; the
point was thus forced into the inner and middle part of the
thigh, and wounded the femoral artery. The medical man
on the spot put a plaster on the little incision in the integuments,
and the wound quickly healed. The boy complained
of uneasiness, but was supposed to be making more of it
than necessary, and was made to go into school as usual.
The limb, however, began to swell, and the boy was brought
to London, supposed to be suffering from abscess, and placed
under the care of Mr. Keate, who, suspecting the evil, carefully
introduced the point of a lancet, and, after a clot of
blood had been forced out, a jet of arterial blood flew across
the room. The hemorrhage was arrested by pressure below
Poupart’s ligament, while Mr. Keate enlarged the opening
in the integuments, and removed two washhand-basinsful of
coagulated blood. He then put his finger on a large opening
in the artery, under which two ligatures were passed by
means of an eye-probe, and the artery was divided between
them. The muscles had been cleanly <i>dissected</i>, and the
cavity extended from the fork internally, and trochanter externally,
to the knee. There was much less suppuration than
could have been expected. The ligatures were detached about
the usual time, and the patient entirely recovered.</p>

<p>This admirable case should be imprinted on the mind of
every surgeon. With the hope that it will be so, I refrain
from commenting on three or four cases which have occurred
within the last two years, in which, from neglect of
the precept inculcated by it, very distressing if not fatal
consequences ensued.</p>

<p>193. There is no precept more important than that which
directs that no operation should be done on a wounded
artery unless it bleed, inasmuch as hemorrhage once arrested
may not be renewed, in which case any operation
must be unnecessary. The following case shows how firmly
the principles on which wounded arteries ought to be treated
were fixed in my mind in the year 1812; and there is no
case during that eventful period to which I look back with
more satisfaction than the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>John Wilson, of the 23d Regiment, was wounded at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
battle of Salamanca by a musket-ball, which entered immediately
behind the trochanter major, passed downward,
forward, and inward, and came out on the inside of the
anterior part of the thigh. The ball could not have injured
the femoral artery, although it might readily have divided
some branch of the profunda. Several days after the receipt
of the injury, I saw this man sitting at night on his
bed, which was on the floor, with his leg bent and out of it,
another man holding a candle, and a third catching the
blood which flowed from the wound, and which had half
filled a large pewter basin. A tourniquet with a thick pad
was placed as high as possible on the upper part of the
thigh, and the officer on duty was requested to loosen it in
the course of an hour; that was done, and the bleeding did
not recommence. The next day, the patient being laid on
the operating table, I removed the coagula from both openings,
and tried to bring on the bleeding by pressure and by
moving the limb; it would not, however, bleed. As there
could be no other guide to the wounded artery, which was
evidently a deep-seated one, I did not like to cut down into
the thigh without it, and the man was replaced in bed, and
a loose precautionary tourniquet applied. At night the
wound bled smartly again, and the blood was evidently
arterial. It was soon arrested by pressure. The next day
I placed him on the operating table again, but the artery
would not bleed. This occurred a third time with the same
result. The bleedings were, however, now almost immediately
suppressed, whenever they took place, by the orderly
who attended upon him; care having been taken to have a
long, thick pad always lying over the femoral artery, from
and below Poupart’s ligament, upon which he made pressure
with his hand for a short time. <i>Absolute rest</i> was enjoined.
The hemorrhage at last ceased without further interference,
and the man recovered.</p>

<p>This case was one of considerable interest at the time,
and is the model one on which the treatment of all such
injuries should be founded. If the wound had bled, I
should have introduced my finger, and enlarged it transversely,
continuing the incision until the opening was sufficiently
large to see to the bottom of the wound or the
bleeding part. It is necessary in such cases to be attentive
to the course of the great vessels and nerves, but not to
the safety of muscular fibers, the division of which leads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
no permanent injury. As pressure on the main trunk led
to the ultimate suppression of the hemorrhage, it may be
said that a ligature placed high up on the femoral artery
would not only have done the same, but would have relieved
the man from the anxiety necessarily dependent on the
momentary fear of a recurrence of the hemorrhage. There
are two objections to this method of proceeding: the likelihood
of mortification taking place, which in similar cases
has been known to occur; and the possibility of the hemorrhage
being renewed through the anastomosing branches.
The temporary suspension of the circulation by pressure
does little or no harm, more particularly where the pad
used is so thick and narrow as to cause it to fall principally
on the artery, and only in a slight degree on the surrounding
parts, which by a little attention may be readily accomplished.
It is not then good practice to cut down upon an
artery on the first occurrence of hemorrhage, unless it be so
severe or so well marked as to leave no doubt of its being
from the main trunk of the vessel itself; nor is it then advisable
to do so, except the artery continue to bleed; for
many a hemorrhage, supposed to have taken place from the
main trunk of an artery, has been permanently stopped by a
moderately continued pressure exercised in the course of the
vessel, and sometimes on the bleeding part itself; particularly
if the blood be of a dark color, indicating that it comes from
the lower end of the vessel.</p>

<p>A painter could not have had a better subject for a picture
illustrative of the miseries which follow a great battle, than
some of the hospitals at Salamanca at one time presented.
Conceive this poor man, late at night, in the midst of others,
some more seriously injured than himself, calmly watching
his blood&mdash;his life flowing away without hope of relief, one
man holding a lighted candle in his hand, to look at it, and
another a pewter washhand-basin to prevent its running over
the floor, until life should be extinct. The unfortunate wretch
next him with a broken thigh, the ends lying nearly at right
angles for want of a proper splint to keep them straight, is
praying for amputation or for death. The miserable being
on the other side has lost his thigh; it has been amputated.
The stump is shaking with spasms; it has shifted itself off
the wisp of straw which supported it. He is holding it with
both hands, in an agony of despair. These Commentaries
are written to prevent as far as possible such horrors; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
they may be prevented by efficient and well-appointed medical
officers; but there must also be greater attention to these
points than has hitherto been given by the government of
the country.</p>

<p>Don Bernardino Garcia Alvarez, captain of the regiment of
Laredo, thirty years of age, was wounded at the battle of
Toulouse by a musket-ball, which passed through the thigh,
a little above its middle. The wound was not considered a
dangerous one until the 30th, twenty days after the injury,
when a considerable bleeding took place; and as the vessel
from which it came seemed to be very deeply seated, the
Spanish surgeon in charge tied the common femoral artery.
I saw the gentleman in consequence of this having been
done. The hemorrhage was suppressed by the operation,
and the limb soon recovered its natural temperature, but
gangrene made its appearance on the great toe on the third
day afterward. It did not seem to increase, but the limb
swelled as if nature were endeavoring to set up sufficient
action to maintain its life; and this continued until the
tenth day after the operation, when he died, completely exhausted.
On the dissection of the limb, the femoral artery
was found to be perfectly sound in every part below where
the ligature had been applied. The vessel which bled could
not be discovered; but it was certainly a branch from the
profunda, and not the femoral itself. In this case the ligature
of the femoral artery destroyed the patient, and the
practice pursued must be condemned. The gunshot wound
should have been largely dilated, at both orifices if necessary,
until the wounded vessel was discovered, which possibly
had not been completely divided by the ulcerative or sloughing
process which had taken place, and its division would in
all probability have suppressed the bleeding.</p>

<p>A young gentleman, aged twelve, accompanying his
brothers shooting, in December, 1844, was struck in the
upper part of the left thigh by a duck-shot, which entered
about three inches below Poupart’s ligament, a little to the
inner side of the femoral artery. He bled until he fainted,
and was taken home. There was no return of the bleeding
for three days, during which time the limb was exceedingly
painful, and soon began to enlarge. After this occasional
and considerable bleedings took place, the limb still continuing
to increase in size. Fomentations and poultices
were applied; irritative fever set in, and the pain was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>tense.
At the end of a fortnight the small hole made by the
shot appeared to be healed over by a thin skin of a blue
color, which tint extended for some distance. The limb was
enormously swollen, with a feeling of distention, which induced
the surgeon to puncture the most prominent part with
a lancet. After some clots of blood had been removed, an
alarming arterial hemorrhage took place. The femoral
artery was now tied high up, below Poupart’s ligament.
The bleeding was in some measure restrained, but not suppressed,
and after a short time it returned at intervals with
augmented violence, until death ensued, three weeks after
the accident.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;If an incision had been made into the thigh in
the course of the wound when the bleeding returned on the
third day, and both ends of the wounded artery had been
tied, the boy would in all probability have recovered. The
ligature placed on the femoral artery above the wound in it
did restrain for a short time the flow of blood, but could not
prevent its flowing from perhaps both ends of the vessel,
until it destroyed the patient. A ligature on the external
iliac would only have caused it to be deferred for a day or
two, until the collateral branches had enlarged, or else he
would have died of mortification.</p>

<p>This really formidable case shows most distinctly the necessity
for always observing the rule of tying the wounded
artery at the part injured, in order that the mistake may not
be made of placing a ligature on the wrong artery&mdash;the constriction
of which may cost the patient his life, while it may
not prevent a return of the bleeding. It also shows that no
loss of blood from a diffused aneurism can equal the danger
which must be encountered, and the mistakes which may be
made, by not laying it open, and seeing the hole in the artery,
or its divided extremities.</p>

<p>Captain Seton, a short man, fat of his age, was wounded
in a duel, in 1845, in the upper part of the right thigh, a
little above and in front of the great trochanter, the wound
being continued across the thigh, its internal opening being
about the middle of the fold of the left or opposite groin.
He lost a great deal of blood at the time, the issue of which
ceased on his fainting. Ten days after the duel his countenance
was blanched, his pulse rather quick and feeble. On
examining the wounds, that on the right hip (the opening of
entrance) was circular, filled with a dry, depressed slough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and there was a narrow, faint blush of redness round its
margin. In the left groin the opening of exit was marked
by a jagged slit, already partly closed by a thin cicatrix.
There was extensive mottled purple discoloration (ecchymosis)
of the skin in both groins, and over the pubes, scrotum,
and upper part of the right thigh. In the right groin was
found a large, oval, visibly pulsating tumor, its long diameter
extending transversely from about an inch and a half on
the inner side of the anterior superior spinous process of the
ilium to about opposite the linea alba, and its lower margin
projecting slightly over Poupart’s ligament into the upper
and inner part of the thigh. On handling this tumor, it appeared
elastic but firm, very slightly tender, and not capable
of any perceptible diminution in bulk by gradual and continued
pressure. The pulsation was distinct in all parts of
the swelling, and was equally evident whether the fingers
were pressed directly backward, or whether they were placed
at its upper and lower margins, and pressed toward the base
of the tumor, in a direction transversely to its long axis, the
parts being for the time relaxed. The femoral artery was
slightly covered by the swelling, and the pulsations of that
vessel were with some difficulty distinguished in the upper
third of the thigh, below the margin of the tumor. This
appeared to depend partly on the natural obesity of the
patient, and partly on a considerable degree of general swelling
of the thigh. Pressure on the femoral artery or over
the abdominal aorta did not arrest the pulsation in the tumor,
and in the former situation was attended with severe pain.
Under these circumstances it was deemed advisable to apply
a ligature on the external iliac artery, and give the patient a
chance of the occurrence of coagulation in the tumor, and
closure of the wounded vessel, before the free re-establishment
of the circulation through the femoral artery. In the present
case it was supposed that mortification of the limb was all
the less likely to occur from the circumstance that the greater
part of the effusion appeared in front of the abdominal parietes,
and therefore exercised less pressure on the femoral vein
than if further extension into the thigh had taken place.
The danger of peritonitis was by this proposal made a new
element in the calculation; but it was estimated that the
chances of this and of mortification of the limb, taken together,
were less unfavorable than the chances of immediate and secondary
hemorrhage attaching to the operation of tying the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
artery at the spot injured. The operation being completed,
the right foot, leg, and thigh were enveloped in lamb’s-wool
and flannel, and the limb elevated on an inclined plane of
pillows, so as to favor the return of blood as much as possible,
and prevent venous congestion. The day on which the
operation was performed was passed in considerable pain, the
patient being restless, and complaining of a sense of burning
in the limb. An anodyne, however, secured him a tolerably
good night’s rest. The day after the limb was found altogether
diminished in bulk, and its temperature equal to that
of the healthy limb; no return of pulsation had taken place
in the tumor. The same evening some tenderness and tension
of the abdomen came on, though the bowels had been
kept in a regular state by occasional small doses of castor-oil.
In the morning of the second day, pain in the belly,
with increased tension, hurried breathing, short, dry cough,
and tenderness over the lower part of the abdomen, were observed.
Pulse quicker and small. Leeches were applied,
and three-grain doses of calomel, with a little Dover’s powder,
ordered every three hours. The symptoms, however,
became rapidly worse; the patient complained of severe
pain in the right leg, and a sensation of great heat over the
whole body, although the actual temperature was rapidly
falling below the natural standard. The right leg also became
cold sooner than the left. At seven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> he became
more easy, and expressed an opinion that he should “do
well;” but in little more than half an hour he expired.</p>

<p><i>Examination after death.</i>&mdash;Swelling and ecchymosis of
the right thigh, particularly at the upper part, and in the
right iliac region; also swelling and ecchymosis of the scrotum,
chiefly in the right side, with general tumefaction of the
abdominal parietes below the umbilicus. A wound into
which the little finger could be passed was on the upper and
outer aspect of the right thigh, about three inches below the
crest of the ilium and about an inch nearer the mesial line
than the great trochanter, and on the left side another
smaller wound, situated about the external aperture of the
left spermatic canal. The first-mentioned wound was open;
the lips of the latter were partially adherent. The course of
the wound was traced from the outside through a dense
layer of fat about two inches in thickness, (on an average.)
It had divided one of the superficial branches of the femoral
artery, about half an inch below Poupart’s ligament, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
about an inch from the main body of the femoral artery;
this had caused a false aneurism. The sac contained about
three ounces of blood. Blood was also effused into the cellular
structure of the scrotum, and downward beneath the
sartorius muscle. The wound passed through the cellular
tissue, across the pubes, and emerged about the situation of
the left external spermatic ring, without having divided the
cord on either side, and was quite superficial to the bladder.
No other artery appeared to have been wounded. When the
parietes of the abdomen were reflected, a considerable quantity
of sero-purulent fluid was found in the abdominal cavity;
and on different parts of the large and small intestines
patches of acute inflammation were observed, particularly on
the ascending arch of the colon. The peritoneum adjoining
the wound of the operation was inflamed, and approaching
to gangrene: it had not been injured by the knife during the
operation. The intestines were unusually large, and distended
with flatus. The other abdominal viscera were
healthy, but loaded to an extraordinary degree with fat.
The ligature had been properly applied to the iliac artery;
the vein was not injured; the surface of the wound and the
cellular tissue in the neighborhood of the artery were
sloughy. There was some enlargement of the right limb,
but apparently no mortification. The femoral artery was
pervious; the course of the wound was through a bed of fat,
fourteen inches in length, and three inches in depth, over the
pubes, and no muscular substance was injured; the blood
found in the aneurismal sac was firmly coagulated, and there
was no mark of recent oozing from the injured artery.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;If this gentleman had been wounded at the
foot of the breach in the wall of Ciudad Rodrigo, in January,
he might, to his great dissatisfaction, have been one of eleven
officers whom I saw lying dead, and as naked as they were
born, on the face of the breach of Badajos, in April. He
would have been saved by <i>one</i> doctor, or an old woman, and
a little cold water, in 1812, and did die of <i>seven</i> in 1845,
after an operation most brilliantly performed, but done in
the wrong place, even if any operation had been necessary,
which it was not. The case is an <i>experimentum crucis</i> of
principles.</p>

<p>The <i>first error</i> committed in this case was in calling and
believing a wounded artery to be a circumscribed, false, or
diffused traumatic aneurism. Nothing can be called an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
aneurism, by which word a dilated vessel or a diseased shut
or closed sac is understood, which has one or more holes in
it, made by a ball, or by anything else, the wound or track
of which remains open. It is simply a case of wound in
which an artery has been divided or injured, and while this
track of the ball remains open, no ingenuity of argument
can make it otherwise. When the external openings made
by the ball have closed, the case may then be called, if there
be a collection of blood, whether fluid or coagulated, one of
circumscribed, false, diffused traumatic aneurism, or anything
else that philologists may please to designate it. The dissection
report proved this case to be simply a small collection
of blood, three ounces and a half, or seven small tablespoonfuls&mdash;communicating
with two open wounds. Calling
this an aneurism, or a shut sac of any kind, was then the
<i>first</i> and fundamental error, as fatal as erroneous.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> error consisted in the belief, <i>contrary to all
experience</i>, that any sac or bag, or collection of blood by
whatever name it may be called, having two openings leading
to, or into it, and communicating with the atmosphere,
could be augmented to any dangerous extent by the further
pouring out of blood from an artery of any size, or from any
artery at all, without some of such extravasated blood being
discharged or forced out through one or both of the open
external wounds in sufficient quantity to show that the
opening in the vessel was not closed.</p>

<p>The <i>first two errors</i>, or defects of principles, gave rise to
the <i>third</i>, viz.: the belief that an operation was necessary
where none was required, the dissection having proved that
the whole idea of the nature of the injury was a mistake:
there was no large artery wounded; the small one, which
had been wounded, had ceased to bleed; the quantity of
blood extravasated did not exceed seven small tablespoonfuls.
The third mistake could not have taken place if the
first two errors had not been committed.</p>

<p>The <i>fourth</i> error occurred from its being taken for granted
that the femoral artery was wounded; and that ascertaining
the fact by opening the small swelling which contained only
three and a half ounces of blood, would be followed by a
fatal hemorrhage; which supposition arose from this swelling
receiving a pulsatory motion from its vicinity to the
femoral artery&mdash;a mistake which should not have occurred;
for it had long before been said, (page 16 of my published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lectures:) “The motion or pulsation of the swelling often
depends on the impulse given to the whole as a mass, by the
great artery against which it is lying, and not upon blood
circulating through it. When blood is extravasated by the
rupture of small vessels in consequence of the passage of a
wheel over the limb&mdash;especially in the thigh, where I have
seen a swelling containing fluid blood pulsate in an almost
alarming manner, until it gradually diminished as the blood
coagulated, when the motion became a mere elevation at
each stroke of the heart&mdash;the <i>whizzing sound or thrill</i>
attendant on a ruptured artery (of a size to require a ligature
being understood) is in these cases wanting, constituting
a very distinguishing mark of this accident.”</p>

<p>Surgeons fifty years ago were afraid of hemorrhage from
the femoral artery, but the practice of the Peninsular war
dissipated such fears. The reason given for not laying open
the wound, and looking at the bleeding artery, in this case,
is ingenious, but not tenable. The patient is said to have
lost a large quantity of blood; and if this were even a fact,
which may, however, be doubted, is there a case on record
of a serious wound of the femoral artery, such as this was
supposed to have been, in which that vessel has been successfully
secured by ligature, without the patient having
equally lost so large a quantity of blood as to be supposed
to be about to die? <i>It has always been so</i>; the reason,
however specious, is not valid, and cannot be admitted.</p>

<p>The <i>fifth</i> error arose from imagining that the considerable
loss of blood supposed to have taken place would have
rendered the patient incapable of bearing more; for it is a
recorded fact that those operations high up on the femoral
artery, from which patients have recovered, have never been
done without great losses of blood having been previously
sustained; and if the patient was so weakened that his heart
and arteries could not bear the abstraction from their contents
of a few ounces more blood&mdash;supposing such loss to
be inevitable&mdash;how could they have power to drive or force
the blood through the limb by the collateral channels, in a
manner sufficient to support its life, when the main trunk
was cut off within the pelvis? <i>They could not do it</i>&mdash;<i>they
have rarely done it</i> under such circumstance; they could
not have done it in this case; and if the patient had not
died within the first forty hours of inflammation of the peritoneum,
to which accident he ought not to have been ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>posed,
he would have died of mortification within forty
hours more, which had already commenced, as shown by the
swelling of the limb and pain in the calf of the leg, which
almost invariably attend such mortification.</p>

<p>The <i>sixth</i> error consisted in the belief that if the femoral
artery had been wounded, a ligature on the external iliac
would have permanently arrested the bleeding. It would,
in all probability, have done no such thing, beyond a day or
two&mdash;perhaps even only for the moment. It is a delusion,
persisted in notwithstanding the most clear and positive
proofs to the contrary. The patient will die of mortification
from the want of blood in the limb, if the circulation
be not re-established; and if this should take place, blood
must find its way into the lower end of the wounded artery,
and perhaps even into the upper, and renew the hemorrhage.</p>

<p>If the femoral artery had been <i>wounded</i>, as was supposed
in this case, but not completely <i>divided</i>, it <i>must</i> and <i>would</i>
have continued to bleed through the external wound, until
the patient died, or a ligature had been placed upon it. It
has been said that, in the case as it actually occurred, the
little artery, which was divided and which had not bled for
some days, could not have been safely tied, if it had bled
again, because it was only an inch long; but this is said in
defiance of every sort of proof which has been given to the
contrary.</p>

<p>As far back as 1815 I said: “There was no foundation
for the theory which declared that a ligature when placed on
an artery such as the femoral would fail, if in the immediate
vicinity of a collateral branch, in consequence of the flow of
blood through this vessel preventing the obstruction and
consolidation of the main branch for a distance sufficient to
enable it to resist the impulse of the blood behind.” This
was said from pure practical facts, free from all kinds of
theory; and the preparation before alluded to, in the
museum of the College of Surgeons, in which I tied the
common iliac artery, will show the mark of a simple thread
around it, and a single line of adhesion resisting the whole
power of the heart, the canal above the spot not being
obliterated.</p>

<p>The <i>seventh</i> error committed in this case was in contravening
the great surgical precept, formed on no inconsiderable
experience during the early part of the war in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Peninsula, “<i>not to perform an operation on an artery
until it bleed</i>.”</p>

<p>194. When a wound occurs in the thigh, implicating the
femoral artery or its branches, and the bleeding cannot be
<i>restrained</i> by a moderate but regulated compression on the
trunk of the vessel, and perhaps on the injured part, recourse
should be had to an operation, by which both ends of the
wounded artery may be secured by ligature; and the <i>impracticability</i>
of doing this should be ascertained only by
the failure of the attempt. If the lower end of the artery
cannot be found at the time, the upper only having bled, a
gentle compression maintained upon the track of the lower
may prevent mischief; but if dark-colored blood should flow
from the wound, which may be expected to come from the
lower end of the artery, and compression does not suffice to
suppress the hemorrhage, the bleeding end of the vessel
must be exposed, and secured near to its extremity.</p>

<p>The instruments which have been invented for the cure of
aneurism, by compressing the main trunk of the artery, will
be found eminently useful, if applied with care, in many cases
of hemorrhage in which it may be doubtful what vessel is
actually injured, as in the case of Wilson, page 215, and in
cases also of wounds of the hand or foot in which bleeding
occurs through the medium of collateral branches. These
instruments, although they cannot conveniently be placed in
the capital cases of instruments, should be in store, whether
with divisional or general hospitals.</p>

<p class="h2sub">MORTIFICATION, ETC.</p>

<p>195. The gangrene, mortification, or sphacelus, consequent
on a wound of the main artery of the lower extremity,
is, in the first instance, <i>local</i> and <i>dry</i>, unless putrefaction be
induced by heat. (See <i>Aphorism</i> 28.) The following case
is a good example of this and of all the other points laid
down as principles or facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>A gentleman received an injury in the upper part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
left thigh, parallel to but a little below Poupart’s ligament,
from the shaft of a van. The late Messrs. Heaviside, Howship,
and Chevalier were sent for immediately, and my attendance
was desired next day. I called the attention of
these gentlemen to the <i>tallowy-white</i> and <i>mottled</i> appearance
of the foot and lower part of the leg, and assured them
that the femoral artery was injured, and the femoral vein in
all probability also, from the rapid appearance of the first
signs of dry gangrene. In this they would not believe, until
the shrinking and drying of the foot and leg became obvious,
the course of the tendons on the instep and toes being marked
by so many dark-red lines under the drying skin above them.
The amputation I recommended below the knee they would
not hear of, although they reluctantly admitted the fact of
the mortification. On the eighteenth day after the accident,
blood flowed from the wound in quantity, of a dark-venous
color. This bleeding I pronounced to be from the lower end
of the artery. My three friends, in whose hands the case
was, could not understand this, and placed a ligature on the
external iliac artery, which did not arrest the bleeding.
They now, although too late, saw their error, and desired
me to do what I pleased, and a ligature secured the lower
end of the artery from which the blood flowed. The man
died exhausted a few days afterward.</p>

<p>This is a remarkable case, deserving the most serious attention.
According to the principle laid down at first as a
general rule, the thigh should have been amputated at the
seat of injury the morning after the accident, when the signs
of mortification of the foot were obvious. But it must be
borne in mind that amputations at the trochanter major or
hip-joint are most formidable and not generally successful
operations; in consequence of which I have recommended
another course, deserving, in such cases, of the most deliberate
consideration and trial. (See <i>Aphorism</i> 29.) The
leg should have been amputated immediately below the knee,
as I had ordered it to be done in the case of Turnbull, (page
202,) because that is the part in all such cases at which nature
seems capable of arresting the progress of the mortification,
if the constitution and powers of the sufferer are
good, and equal to the calls upon them. The impairing,
the destructive influence a mortified leg exerts on the whole
system is removed, and an amputation substituted for it of
comparatively little moment. When the hemorrhage took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
place, the lower end of the artery should have been tied.
The upper end never bled, and the ligature on the iliac artery
was useless. In this case, it is probable, as the vein
was also injured, that the life of the part at and above the
knee might not have been preserved, and the patient would
have died.</p>

<p>In a case of the kind in which the artery was wounded at
the <i>lower</i> part of the thigh instead of the <i>upper</i>, amputation
at or just below the wound may be the proper course;
this amputation, although dangerous, being much less so
than one at the upper part of the thigh or hip-joint. Nevertheless,
amputation should not be had recourse to unless
the extension of the mortification is beyond a doubt.</p>

<p>196. In Aphorism 29, it is strongly recommended not to
amputate a thigh when mortification has stopped just below
the knee, and a line of separation has been formed between
the dead and the living parts&mdash;an opinion formed on a principle
laid down in opposition to those usually received by
the profession at large, and which have been entertained
from the fact that amputations done under these circumstances
are commonly fatal.</p>

<p>Richard Cook, aged fifty, a mason, while sitting on a
square block of stone, on the 23d of February, was struck
by another, which drove the popliteal space or ham against
the edge of the block on which he sat, causing him great
pain, and otherwise greatly bruising the leg, although no
bones were fractured, nor was the skin torn. The limb, on
his admission into the Westminster Hospital half an hour
afterward, was much larger than the other, and of a dark
reddish-blue color, evidently from the bruise or extravasation
of blood, which appeared to be still issuing from the
vessel or vessels, as the limb continued to increase in size,
until it became at last greatly swollen. The pulsation of
neither the anterior nor the posterior tibial artery could be
distinguished through the swelling the next morning. The
bowels were opened, and a cold spirit lotion was applied to
the calf and around the leg, and the swelling somewhat subsided,
the limb becoming quite a blue-black, which, with the
tenseness of the parts, distinctly indicated the effusion of a
large quantity of blood. It was soon obvious that greater
mischief had occurred than had been expected; and on the
2d of March, as vesications, filled with a bloody fluid, were
formed on the outside of the leg, over the fibula, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
whole limb was manifestly about to pass into a state of gangrene,
if it had not already done so, I prepared everything
for tying the popliteal or other arteries, if found necessary,
and made a long and deep incision on the outer and back
part of the leg, through the integuments and muscles posterior
to the fibula, and removed a considerable quantity of
coagulated blood from between the muscles and from a large
cavity which extended upward into the ham, without causing
further hemorrhage; in no part of that cavity could an
artery be felt. The patient’s countenance and body had
assumed a jaundiced hue; the pulse was very quick; the
tongue foul; the countenance sunken; the skin hot; the
head wandering. Poultices of linseed-meal and stale beer
were applied, with gentle, stimulating applications. Brandy
and wine were ordered in proper quantities every hour or
two, with sufficient doses of the muriate of morphia at night
to allay irritation and induce sleep. The incision, together
with these remedies, gave great relief, and on the 7th the
man seemed to have been saved from a state of the most
imminent danger. On the 8th the pulse was 112, the tongue
clean, the skin of a whiter color, the bowels opened by injections;
eight ounces of brandy were given in the twenty-four
hours; wine, with sago, arrow-root, jelly, oranges, and
anything he chose to ask for. The greatest cleanliness was
observed, and the chloride of lime was used in profusion all
around him. The mortification of the limb was complete;
a line of separation formed about four inches below the knee
in front, and extended behind toward the ham. On the 26th,
the dead parts having almost entirely separated from the
bones all round, those which remained were cut through
where dead, the bones were sawn about five inches below the
knee, and the lower part of the limb removed, leaving an
irregular, and, in part, a granulating stump, with an inch of
bone projecting from it. On the 24th of May this portion
was found to be loose; diluted nitric acid had been applied
to its surface, and on the 20th of June it separated. On the
16th of August Cook left the hospital in good health, with
a very good stump, having cost the hospital £57 in extra
diet. In this case, there can be little doubt of the popliteal
artery having been torn; and if the incision made on the
2d had been had recourse to during the first two or three
days, and the artery sought for, and secured if found bleeding,
it is possible the mortification might have been pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>vented;
although it is probable, from the pressure arising
from the great extravasation and coagulation of blood, that
the collateral circulation was so much impeded as not to
have been able to maintain the life of the limb below even
during that time. The incision made on the 2d saved the
life of the patient, by taking off the tension of the part, and
relieving thereby in a remarkable manner the constitutional
irritation which hourly appeared likely to destroy him; indeed,
no one expected anything but his dissolution. When
the line of separation had formed, he was evidently unequal
to undergo the operation of amputation, in order to make
a good stump, without great risk, and the dead parts were
therefore merely separated for the sake of cleanliness and
comfort. Experience has demonstrated in too many cases
of the kind that the formal operation of amputation at this
time, as recommended by most modern surgeons, would in
all probability have cost him his life.</p>

<p>The application of powdered charcoal, particularly that
made from bog earth, or of areca wood, or Macdougall’s
disinfecting powder, or of the disinfecting liquids now in
use, such as the chlorides of lime, sodium, and zinc, removes
in a great degree the intolerable odor which renders the
room of the sufferer unbearable, and essentially interferes
with his amendment. Incisions should be made into the
dead parts to allow the evacuation of the fluids contained
within them, while the parts themselves may be removed
from time to time; so that when the period arrives at which
an amputation is considered advisable, the bones, if of the
leg, may be sawn through at or below the line of separation,
and nearly the whole of the mortified soft parts removed,
so as to leave little of those which are dead and
offensive. This operation is done without the patient feeling
it; it gives rise to no irritation, inconvenience, or danger;
Nature is not interfered with in her operations; and
in due time the parts which remain are separated and fall
off, leaving a stump more or less good, but which will always
bear the application of a wooden leg; and thus the knee-joint
is saved&mdash;a saving of no small importance to the patient,
and a new precept in surgery.</p>

<p>197. The following cases may be considered conclusive:&mdash;</p>

<p>A private of the 5th division of infantry received a wound
at the battle of Salamanca from a musket-ball, which passed
across the back part of the right leg, from above downward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and inward. It entered about two inches below and behind
the head of the fibula, and passed out near the inner edge
of the tibia. There was little blood lost at the time, and it
was considered to be a simple wound; eight days after the
injury, some blood flowed with the discharge; this increased
during the night, and, on examining the limb on the morning
of the ninth day, it was evidently injected with blood,
which flowed of a scarlet color from both orifices. It being
doubtful which vessel was wounded&mdash;whether it was the
trunk of the popliteal artery, or the posterior tibial or peroneal
after its division into these branches&mdash;it was thought
advisable to place a ligature on the femoral artery about the
middle of the thigh, which suppressed the hemorrhage. The
case was now shown to me, as one in proof of the incorrectness
of the opinion I had a few days before stated, of the
impropriety of such an operation being done. The seeming
success did not long continue; hemorrhage again took place
from the original wound, and the limb was then amputated.
The posterior tibial artery had been injured, and
had sloughed. The man died.</p>

<p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;A straight incision, directly through the back
of the calf of the leg, of six inches in length, and two ligatures
on the wounded artery, would have saved this man’s
leg and life.</p>

<p>Henry Vigarelie, a private in the German legion, was
wounded on the 18th of June, at the battle of Waterloo, by
a musket-ball, which entered the right leg immediately
behind and below the inner head of the tibia, inclining
downward, and under or before a part of the soleus and
gastrocnemius muscles, and coming out through them, four
inches and three-quarters below the head of the fibula, nearly
in the middle, but toward the side of the calf of the leg. In
this course it was evident that the ball must have passed
close to the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries; but, as
little inflammation followed, and no immediate hemorrhage,
it was considered to be one of the slighter cases. On the
latter days of June he occasionally lost a little blood from
the wound, and on the 1st of July a considerable hemorrhage
took place, which was suppressed by the tourniquet, and
did not immediately recur on its removal. It bled, however,
at intervals, during the night; and on the morning of
the 2d it became necessary to reapply the tourniquet, and
to adopt some means for his permanent relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
The man had lost a large quantity of blood from the
whole of the bleedings; his pulse was 110, the skin hot,
tongue furred, with great anxiety of countenance: the limb
was swollen from the application of the tourniquet from
time to time, a quantity of coagulated blood had forced
itself under the soleus in the course of the muscles, increasing
the size of the leg, and florid blood issued from both
openings on taking the compression off the femoral artery.
On passing the finger into the outer opening, and pressing
it against the fibula, a sort of aneurismal tumor could be
felt under it, and the hemorrhage ceased, indicating that the
peroneal artery was in all probability the vessel wounded.</p>

<p>In this case there was, in addition to the wound of the
artery, a quantity of blood between the muscles, which in
gunshot wounds, accompanied by inflammation, is always a
dangerous occurrence, as it terminates in profuse suppuration
of the containing parts, and frequently in gangrene.
Its evacuation therefore became an important consideration,
even if the hemorrhage had ceased spontaneously.</p>

<p>The leg having been condemned for amputation above
the knee, the officers in charge were pleased to place the
man at my disposal: and being laid on his face, with the
calf of the leg uppermost, I made an incision about seven
inches in length in the axis of the limb, taking the shot-hole
nearly as a central point, and carried it by successive strokes
through the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles down to the
deep fascia, when I endeavored to discover the bleeding
artery; but this was more difficult than might be supposed,
after such an opening had been made. The parts were not
easily separated, from the inflammation that had taken
place; and those in the immediate track of the ball were in
the different stages from sphacelus to a state of health, as
the ball in its course had produced its effect upon them, or
their powers of life were equal or unequal to the injury
sustained.</p>

<p>The sloughing matter mixed with coagulated blood readily
yielded to the back of the knife, but was not easily dissected
out. The spot which the arterial blood came from was
distinguished through it, but the artery could not be perceived,
the swelling and the depth of the wound rendering
any operation on it difficult. To obviate this inconvenience,
I made a transverse incision outward, from the shot-hole to
the edge of the fibula, which enabled me to turn back two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
little flaps, and gave greater facility in the use of the instruments
employed. I could now pass a tenaculum under the
spot whence the blood came, which I raised a little with it,
but could not distinctly see the wounded artery in the altered
state of parts, so as to secure it separately. I therefore
passed a small needle, bearing two threads, a sufficient
distance above the tenaculum to induce me to believe it was
in sound parts, but including very little in the ligature,
when the hemorrhage ceased; another was passed in the
same manner below, and the tenaculum withdrawn. The
coagula under the muscles were removed, the cavity washed
out by a stream of warm water injected through the external
opening, the wound gently drawn together by two or three
straps of adhesive plaster, and the limb enveloped in cloths
constantly wetted with cold water. The patient was placed
on milk diet.</p>

<p>On the 4th, two days after the operation, the wound was
dressed, and looked very well; the weather being very hot,
two straps of plaster only were applied to prevent the parts
separating. On the 5th a poultice was laid over the dressings,
in lieu of the cold water, the stiffness becoming disagreeable.
On the 6th, as the wound, although open in all
its extent, did not appear likely to separate more, the
plasters were omitted, and a poultice alone applied. On
the 8th and 9th it suppurated kindly; and on the 10th, or
eight days from the operation, the ligatures came away, the
limb being free from tension, and the patient in an amended
state of health, his medical treatment having been steadily
attended to.</p>

<p>The man was brought to England, to the York Hospital
at Chelsea, and walked about without appearing lame,
although he could not do so for any great distance. He
suffered no pain, except an occasional cramp in the ball of
the foot, and some contraction of the toes, which took place
generally when he rose in a morning, and continued for a
minute or two, until he put them straight with his hand;
this I did not attribute to the operation, but to some additional
injury done to the nerves by the ball in its course
through the leg.</p>

<p>This case, which has been followed by many others equally
successful, even after the femoral artery had been ineffectually
tied, established the practice now followed in England
by all educated surgeons; and is another of those great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
additions to surgery for which science is indebted to the
Peninsular war.</p>

<p>198. It may be permitted to repeat, that if an artery such
as the axillary be laid bare previously to an operation for
amputation at the shoulder, and the surgeon take it between
his finger and thumb, he will find that the slightest possible
pressure will be sufficient to stop the current of blood through
it. Retaining the same degree of pressure on the vessel, he
may cut it across below his finger and thumb, and not one
drop of blood will flow. If the artery be fairly divided by
the last incision which separates the arm from the body,
without any pressure being made upon it, it will propel its
blood with a force which is more apparent than real. All
that is required to suppress this usually alarming gush of
blood is to place the end of the forefinger directly against
the orifice of the artery, and with the least possible degree
of pressure consistent with keeping it steadily in one position
the hemorrhage will be suppressed. It is more important
to know that if the orifice of the artery, from a natural
curve in the vessel, or from other accidental causes, happen
at the same time to retract and to turn a little to one side,
so as to be in close contact with the side or end of a muscle,
the very support of contact will sometimes be sufficiently
auxiliary to prevent its bleeding.</p>

<p>In amputation at the hip-joint, the femoral and profunda
arteries are frequently divided at or just below the origin of
the latter, and bleed furiously if disregarded; but the
slightest compression between the finger and thumb stops
both at once. They never have given me the smallest concern
in these operations, or others of a similar nature; and
surgeons should learn to hold all arteries that can be taken
between the finger and thumb in great contempt. It is
quite impossible for a man to be a good surgeon&mdash;to do his
patient justice in great and difficult operations attended by
hemorrhage, unless he has this feeling&mdash;unless his mind is
fully satisfied of the truth of these observations. While his
attention ought to be directed to other important circumstances,
it is perhaps absorbed by the dread of bleeding, by
the idle fear that he will not be able to compress the artery
and restrain the bleeding from it&mdash;that he may have half a
dozen vessels bleeding at once&mdash;that his patient will die on
the table before him. Once fairly in dismay, and the patient
is really in danger; but, endowed with that confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
which is only to be acquired through precept supported
by experience, he surveys the scene with perfect calmness:
taking the great artery between the finger and thumb of one
hand, he places the points of all the other fingers, of both
hands if necessary, on the next largest vessels; or he presses
the flaps or sides of the wound together until his other hand
can be set at liberty by an assistant, or in consequence of a
ligature having been passed around the principal artery.
This is a scene sufficient to try the presence of mind of any
man; but he is not a good surgeon who is not equal to it&mdash;who
does not delight in the recollection of it when his
patient is in safety, and his recovery assured. It was in
consequence of what was then considered the too great
boldness of the practice that my old friend, Sir Charles Bell,
whose loss to science cannot be too much regretted, represented
me seated on a pack saddle on the back of a bourro,
(<i>Anglice</i>, a jack-ass,) on the top of the Pyrenees, expatiating
on their merits (which he did not believe) to the descendants
of the Bearnois of Henri Quatre on one side, and to
the children of the lieges of Ferdinand and Isabella on the
other; but no one now disputes their accuracy. The surgery
of the Peninsular war was many years in advance of
the surgery of civil life.</p>

<p>199. The principles laid down for the treatment of
wounded arteries in the <i>lower</i> extremity are equally to be
observed with respect to those of the <i>upper</i>. There is,
however, little or no fear of mortification taking place in the
upper extremity, the collateral circulation being more direct
and free; while there is greater danger from this cause of
hemorrhage from the lower end of the artery, if a ligature
should not have been placed upon it, or if it should not be
retained a sufficient length of time.</p>

<p>200. The error of placing a ligature on the subclavian
artery above the clavicle, for a wound of the axillary below
it, should never be committed. One person dies for one
who lives after this operation, when performed under favorable
circumstances, independently of the loss which may
be sustained by a recurrence of bleeding from the original
wound, which is always to be expected and ought to take
place; when it does not happen, it is the effect of accident,
which accident in all probability occurs from the state of
<i>absolute rest</i> having been carefully observed.</p>

<p>201. The necessity for an aneurismal sac below the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
clavicle, and for its remaining and continuing to remain
intact, until the cure is completed, when the subclavian
artery has been tied above, is rendered unmistakable by the
following case:&mdash;</p>

<p>Ambrose C. was admitted into the Charing Cross
Hospital, in August, 1848, in consequence of a bruise from
a sack of beans; there was axillary aneurism, extending
under the pectoral muscle up to the clavicle. A ligature
was applied in the usual situation on the outside of the
scalenus muscle, and came away on the twenty-second day.
The aneurismal sac suppurated, and burst three days afterward,
when a quantity of pus and blood, partly fluid, partly
coagulated, but very offensive, was discharged. The opening
was enlarged, and everything appeared to be going on
well, at which time I saw him. On the nineteenth day after
the ligature came away, I visited him again with Mr. Hancock,
and merely observed that he must keep himself very
quiet, and I thought he would do well. In the evening he
died from hemorrhage, while eating some gruel. On examination
after death, the artery was found to be sound, except
where it communicated with the sac by an opening three-quarters
of an inch in length. The ligature had been applied
midway between the thyroid axis and the first of the
thoracic branches. There was a small coagulum, of half an inch
in length, both internal and external to the ligature, <i>but not
extending to the branch above or below it</i>. The artery
was of its natural size as far as the remains of the sac, but
beyond it the axillary artery was diminished; the remains
of the sac were void of coagulum, except where it communicated
with the artery, to which opening a small coagulum
had adhered, but had given way at its lower part, and thus
caused his death. <i>Between the opening and the ligature</i>,
five large branches entered into or were given off by the
artery, and through some of these blood was brought round
by the collateral branches in an almost direct manner, so
that the man’s life depended on the resistance offered by
the small coagulum after the sac had given way; proving
in an exemplary manner the value of the sac remaining
entire.</p>

<p>If this case will not convince the incredulous, it would be
useless to bring even the sufferers in such cases from their
graves, to affirm the fact of the inapplicability of the theory
of aneurism to the treatment of a wounded artery&mdash;of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
impropriety of placing a ligature on the subclavian artery
above the clavicle, for a wound of the artery below it.</p>

<p>Corporal W. Robinson, 48th Regiment, was wounded at
the battle of Toulouse, by a piece of shell, which rendered
amputation of the right leg immediately necessary, and
so injured the right arm as to cause its loss close to the
shoulder-joint eighteen days afterward. At the end of a
month the ligatures had separated, and the wound was
nearly healed, although a small abscess had formed on the
inside, near where the upper part of the tendon of the
pectoralis major had been separated from the bone. Sent
to Plymouth, this little abscess formed again, and was opened
on the 2d of August, three months after the amputation.
The next day blood flowed so impetuously from it as to
induce the surgeon to make an incision, and seek for the
bleeding vessel, which could not be found. The late Staff-Surgeon
Dease, warned by the case of Sergeant Lillie,
(page 198,) strongly objected to the subclavian artery being
tied above the clavicle, and, true to the principle inculcated
at Toulouse, advised the application of a ligature below the
clavicle on a sound part of the artery, but as near as possible
to that which was diseased. The operation was done by the
senior officer, Mr. Dowling, who carried an incision from the
clavicle downward through the integuments and great pectoral
muscle, until the pectoralis minor was exposed. This
was then divided, and a ligature placed beneath it on the
artery where it was sound, at a short distance from the face
of the stump, where it was diseased. The man recovered
without further inconvenience.</p>

<p>202. In all those cases in which it has been supposed
necessary to place a ligature on the artery above the clavicle,
after a <i>failure</i> in the attempt to find the artery below it,
the failure has occurred from <i>the error committed</i> in not
dividing the integuments and great pectoral muscle <i>directly
across</i> from the lower edge of the clavicle downward. It
is quite useless dividing these parts in the course of the
fibers of the muscle, and the case of Robinson is the model
on which all such operations should be done. If this operation
had not succeeded, the ligature of the artery above the
clavicle was a further resource; but as the artery was sound
below, with the exception of the end engaged in the face of
the stump, the operation was successful; no doubt should
be entertained in such cases of the propriety of an operation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which is attended with little risk, compared with that which
destroys one man for every one it saves.</p>

<p>203. Punctured wounds of the arteries of the arm and
forearm ought to be treated by pressure applied especially
to the part injured, and to the limb generally; but when the
bleeding cannot be restrained in this manner, in consequence
of the extent of the external wound, the bleeding artery is
to be exposed, and a ligature applied above, and another
below the part injured, whether the artery be radial, ulnar,
or interosseal.</p>

<p>204. When the external wound closes under pressure, and
blood is extravasated in such quantity under the fascia and
between the muscular structures as is not likely to be removed
by absorption under general pressure, the wounded artery
should be laid bare by incision and secured in a similar
manner, even at the expense of any muscular fiber which
may intervene.</p>

<p>205. When an aneurismal tumor forms <i>some time</i> after
such an accident, in the upper part of the forearm in particular,
the application of a ligature on the brachial artery
is admissible, on the Hunterian principle.</p>

<p>206. When the ulnar artery is wounded in the hand,
which is comparatively a superficial vessel, two ligatures
should be placed upon it in the manner hereafter to be
directed. When the opening is small, pressure may be tried.</p>

<p>207. When the radial artery is wounded in the hand, in
which situation it is deep seated, the case requires greater
consideration. When there is a large open wound, and the
bleeding end or ends of the artery can be seen, a ligature
should be placed on each; but this cannot always be done
without more extensive incisions than the tendinous and
nervous parts will justify.</p>

<p>208. When search has been made by incisions through the
fascia, (as extensively as the situation of the tendons and
nerves in the hand will permit,) which are best effected by
introducing a bent director under it, the current of blood,
through either the ulnar or the radial artery at the wrist, or
even through both, should be arrested in turn by pressure,
which in most cases of this kind will succeed, if properly applied,
and thus show the vessel injured. The bleeding point
should be fully exposed, and all coagula removed, when a
piece of lint, rolled tight and hard, but of a size only sufficient
to cover the bleeding point, should be laid upon it. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
second and larger hard piece should then be placed over it,
and so on, until the compresses rise so much above the level
of the wound as to allow the pressure to be continued and
retained on the proper spot, without including the neighboring
parts. A piece of linen, kept constantly wet and cold,
should be applied over the sides of the wound, which should
not be closed so as to allow of any blood being freely evacuated;
and if the back of the hand be then laid on a padded
splint, broader than the hand, a narrow roller may be so applied
as to retain the compresses in their proper situation,
without making compression on or impeding the swelling of
the adjacent parts, the fingers being bent, in order to relax
the palmar aponeurosis&mdash;a proceeding which should never
be neglected in any operation in the palm of the hand. It
has been lately proposed by M. Thierry, a French surgeon,
to raise and bend the arm, as a means of impeding the circulation
where the artery passes over the elbow-joint, and
the proposal deserves adoption, but not to the extent he
recommends, which cannot be long submitted to. Pressure
made at the same time on the radial or ulnar artery, or on
both, by a piece of hard wood two inches long, shaped like
a flattened pencil, is much more effectual, and more to be
depended upon. When from the bones being broken, or the
hand so swollen, or from other circumstances, pressure, however
lightly and carefully applied, cannot be borne in the
manner directed, and the attempts to secure the artery at
the bleeding spot have failed, and pressure on the radial or
ulnar artery has been equally unsuccessful, in consequence
of the swelling or other circumstances, both may be tied at
the wrist in preference to placing a ligature on the brachial
artery, although that even must be done as a last resource,
if the bleeding should still continue. If it be asked why not
do this in the first, rather than in the last instance, the answer
is, that it has so often failed to prevent a renewal of the
bleeding from both ends of a wounded artery in the hand,
that complete dependence cannot be placed upon it, particularly
if there should be a division high in the arm of the
brachial into the radial and ulnar arteries. When, however,
the arteries leading to the wound have been secured, either
by pressure or ligature, <span class="allsmcap">NEAR</span> to the part, and the bleeding
returns by the collateral circulation, which in the hand is so
free, the arresting the supply of blood through the main
trunk may and often has suppressed the hemorrhage, at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
events for a sufficient time to enable the injured parts to recover
themselves, provided the forearm is bent and raised,
and the person kept at <i>rest</i> in the most restricted manner,
without which this operation will in all probability fail. It
is in these cases that the instrument alluded to, page 226,
will be useful, rendering the ligature on the trunk of the
vessel unnecessary, more particularly if the bleeding should
appear to depend on some peculiarity in the structure of the
coats of the artery.</p>

<p>209. When the obstacle to the application of pressure
arises from the injured state of the metacarpal bone or
bones, one or more should be removed, with the fingers if
necessary, so as to expose a clear and new surface, on which
the bleeding vessels may be seen and secured. In some
cases, particularly if there should be a hemorrhagic tendency
in the arterial system generally, as known from previous accidents,
the first compress may be wetted with the perchloride
of iron, the ol. terebinth., the dilute sulphuric acid, or the
tincture of matico; these remedies may be also administered
internally. Some new styptics have lately been much lauded
in Malta and other places, but sufficient proofs have not been
given of their efficiency.</p>

<p>210. When the radial artery is wounded as it turns from
the back to the inside of the hand, to form the deep-seated
palmar arch, it meets a branch of the ulnar nerve about to
terminate in the muscles of the thumb. If the treatment by
pressure above recommended should not succeed, the muscles
forming what is called the web, between the thumb and metacarpal
bone of the forefinger, should be cut through, and the
bleeding vessel exposed. They are the adductor pollicis on
the inside, and the abductor indicis on back of the hand.</p>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE ARTERIES, ETC.</p>

<p>211. The precept so strongly insisted upon, that no operation
should be done on a wounded artery unless it bleed,
and at the place from which it bleeds, has been particularly
opposed with reference to the neck, the opponents believing
that placing a ligature on the primitive carotid is an operation
not attended with much risk, and that it may therefore
be done as a precautionary measure when the wounded part
does not bleed; this statement is an error. Of thirty-eight
cases collected by Dr. Norris in 1847, in which this vessel
was tied for aneurism, twenty-six died, and twelve suffered
from affection of the brain, the frequency of which occurrence
has been singularly overlooked by practical surgeons;
although proving, in a very marked manner, that the operation
of tying the primitive carotid is not a trifling affair, and
that the success, when compared with the failures, is only as
one and one. A much more important objection is the difficulty
of deciding, in many cases of wounds of the neck, what
artery is wounded, and what trunk should be tied; whether
it be the external carotid or its branches, or the internal, or
the vertebral artery. Errors have been committed on all these
points by men of the greatest anatomical and surgical knowledge;
the trunk of a sound artery having been tied instead
of that of a wounded one, inflicting thereby on the patient
a second and useless wound, more dangerous, perhaps, than
the original one it was intended to relieve.</p>

<p>When Professor of Anatomy and Surgery to the College
of Surgeons in 1830, I stated that in wounds of the neck
which rendered it advisable to place a ligature on some part
of the carotid, on account of the supposed impracticability
of laying bare the bleeding orifice, it was generally the <i>external</i>
carotid which should be secured, rather than the
primitive trunk; there not being sufficient reason for cutting
off the supply of blood to the head by the internal
carotid, unless the operation on the external carotid should
fail. This direction should be implicitly followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
212. A man was wounded by a ball in the side of the
neck, and suffered severely from secondary hemorrhage.
Some days after being brought into the hospital, M. Breschet,
unable to arrest the bleeding, was about to apply a
ligature to the common carotid, when the man died in time
to prevent it. On examination after death, the vertebral was
found to be the artery wounded, between the second and
third vertebræ. The ligature of the carotid, had he lived
a little longer, would have been a useless addition to his
misery.</p>

<p>Professor Chiari, of Naples, tied the trunk of the left
common carotid on the 18th of July, 1829, on account of
a false aneurism below the mastoid process, consecutive to
a wound made by a sharp-pointed instrument under the
angle of the jaw. The man died on the ninth day, and the
wounded artery was found to be the vertebral, between the
transverse processes of the first and second vertebræ. M.
Ramaglia says, a man, thirty-nine years of age, was wounded
by a sharp-cutting, penetrating instrument, below the left
ear, from which an aneurismal swelling resulted. The common
carotid was tied, but as this did not arrest the pulsations
of the aneurism, the ligature was removed, and the
patient, after suffering from various accidents, died, when
the vertebral was found to be the artery wounded.</p>

<p>M. Maisonneuve, of Paris, lately laid the following most
instructive case before the Academy of Medicine: A lady
was shot by her husband, who stood close to her, with a
pistol loaded with ball. The wound was inflicted on the
anterior part of the neck, on a level with the left side of the
cricoid cartilage. The hemorrhage had been considerable
when the surgeons, Messrs. Maisonneuve and Favrot, arrived,
though the wound looked at first as if the ball had not
penetrated deeply. There were pain and numbness of the
left arm; respiration, voice, and deglutition were, however,
normal. On examining with the probe, it was found that
the cricoid cartilage had been bared, and that the ball had
then run from above downward, leaving the trachea and
œsophagus internally, and the common carotid artery, the
internal jugular vein, and the pneumogastric nerve externally,
and was impacted in the body of the sixth cervical
vertebra, where it could easily be felt. Some attempts at
extraction were made, but they caused so much pain that
they were given up. The patient was bled six times in four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
days, and had large doses of opium; she improved considerably
under this treatment, and the inflammation was
very moderate.</p>

<p>On the eighth day hemorrhage occurred at the wound,
and again on the ninth, but it ceased of itself on each occasion.
When, however, it broke out a third time, the
surgeons proceeded at once to search for the bleeding vessel.
An incision about three inches long was made on the
anterior edge of the sterno-mastoid muscle, a little external
to the wound inflicted by the ball; the carotid sheath was
then brought into view, and the vessels were found intact.
The cricoid cartilage and the first rings of the trachea were
afterward seen to have been grazed by the ball, which was
found implanted in the body of the sixth cervical vertebra,
whence it was easily extracted. Severe hemorrhage ensued
immediately upon the removal of the ball, the blood seeming
to proceed from the vertebral artery, which appeared to
have been wounded within the canal formed by the foramina
of the transverse processes. By placing the finger on the
hole left by the ball, the orifice whence the blood issued was
distinctly seen; forceps were applied to it, and held firmly
for a little while to arrest the hemorrhage. An aneurismal
needle, with a very small curve, was then made to carry a
double thread behind the vessel. One of these was used to
tie the artery above, and the other below the aperture
whence the blood issued.</p>

<p>The operators at first thought they were mistaken in supposing
that they had tied the vertebral artery, as the vessel
seemed quite free, while it is known to be protected by the
transverse processes in that locality, and believed they had
secured the inferior thyroid. The hemorrhage ceased at
once, and some smaller vessels were then tied, among which
was the inferior thyroid artery. Everything went on favorably
at first; the threads fell on the ninth day after the deligation
of the vessel, and the patient remained in a satisfactory
state for the next five days, when severe febrile
symptoms, unpreceded by shivering, set in; and on the
eighteenth day after the operation, the twenty-seventh after
the infliction of the wound, the patient was suddenly seized
with a violent pain in the cervical region, cried out loudly,
and fell into deep coma, which lasted for about seven hours,
when she expired, notwithstanding the most strenuous means
were used to rouse her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
On the post-mortem examination, the course of the ball
was found as stated above, viz., it had run from the integuments
to the body of the sixth cervical vertebra, leaving the
trachea and œsophagus internally, and the carotid sheath
and its contents externally, untouched. The inferior thyroid
artery was wounded just before it reaches the thyroid gland,
and had a firm clot, about half an inch in length, filling its
cylinder. The transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra
was fractured, and had left the wounded vertebral
artery unprotected. The vessel above and below the wound
in its coats was filled with a firm clot for about an inch in
each direction. The body of the sixth cervical vertebra had
been perforated by the ball, which had dug for itself a canal
communicating with the cavity of the spine by a small aperture,
evidently of very recent formation. This aperture resulted
clearly from the necrosis of the thin shell of bone
which formed the bottom of the canal. The cancelous texture
of the body of the vertebra was infiltrated with pus, and
a sero-purulent fluid was found in the spinal canal, both in
the cellular tissue external to the dura mater and in the
sub-serous texture of the meninges. No other lesion existed
in any other part of the frame.</p>

<p>213. M. S., a female, aged fifty-three, was admitted into
the Westminster Hospital, with a large, movable tumor
in the neck, under the sterno-mastoid muscle of the right
side. An operation having been commenced for its removal,
the tumor was found to be of a more than doubtful character,
and to dip down between and behind the great vessels of the
neck. In the course of the operation, the external carotid
was opened a little above its bifurcation, and a ligature was
applied on the common carotid. The bleeding was not in
the least arrested; a ligature was then placed on the external
carotid above the hole in the artery, which still continued
to pour out blood; a third ligature was now put
upon the internal carotid, with no better success. A fourth
ligature was then applied on the external carotid, below the
hole in it, including the superior thyroid, which was given
off at that part; after which the bleeding ceased, and never
returned. Three ligatures came away in three weeks; the
fourth remained during five weeks. The patient recovered
from the operation, but the tumor grew again, and the
woman died exhausted at the end of six months. On examination
after death, the arteries referred to were found to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
be obliterated for some distance above and below the parts
injured.</p>

<p>The utter inefficiency of everything but the two ligatures,
the one immediately above, the other immediately below the
part opened, could not be more distinctly proved, if a case
were even invented for the purpose; and the fact could not
be more satisfactorily shown that in every case of wounded&mdash;not
aneurismal&mdash;artery in the neck, one ligature should be
applied above, and another below the opening in the injured
vessel, and not one alone on the common trunk, even if that
should be the part injured.</p>

<p>It is argued that when a man has his internal carotid cut
on the inside of his throat, by a foreign body of any kind
thrust through his mouth, the artery cannot be tied by
two ligatures at the wounded part through the mouth, not
even if it were enlarged from ear to ear. What, then, is to
be done? The artery should be secured by ligature by an
incision made on the outside of the neck. This being admitted,
the question then is, shall the wounded artery be
laid bare at the part injured, or two inches or so lower down,
where the main trunk can be most easily got at by men of
even very moderate anatomical knowledge?&mdash;an operation
which has frequently failed, although it has frequently succeeded,
and is therefore most approved. <i>I am willing, for
the present</i>, to consider it nearly impracticable to tie the
internal carotid safely from the outside of the neck, at the
part wounded, without great anatomical knowledge, and to
accept, for the moment, as the proper operation, the ligature
of the common trunk of the carotid, at the distance of
two or more inches, being the operation of Anel; but I
venture to ask, with what fairness can this operation, thus
done on one side of the neck, at the distance of two inches,
the other side remaining sound, be considered similar to that
of Mr. Hunter, done on the thigh for a wound in the calf of
the leg, at the distance of perhaps twenty inches, with all
the intervening collateral branches perfectly sound? It
cannot be considered an analogous operation, with propriety
or fairness, nor ought the one to be compared with
the other, although it is done; and thus the subject is mystified
to all those who do not understand it thoroughly. It
is because English surgeons miscall this the operation of
Hunter, that French surgeons claim the operation of Hunter
as that of Anel, and deny the priority of Hunter, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the two operations are essentially distinct. The operation
of Anel for <i>aneurism</i> of the popliteal artery would be destructive;
the operation of Hunter for <i>a wound</i> of the
popliteal artery would be equally so.</p>

<p>This point must, however, be pressed further. Let us suppose
that the internal carotid has been opened by a wound
inflicted through the mouth, and death is about to follow,
unless the hole in the artery can be tied up. How is it to be
done? The Hunterian theorists say it is <i>impracticable</i> to
tie the artery at the wounded part, and the primitive trunk
must therefore be secured.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose that a ligature has been placed on the
common carotid, and the bleeding continues; what is to be
done? By the Hunterian and Anellian theorists there is
nothing more to be done&mdash;the patient <i>must</i> die. By my
theory there is another operation to be done, and the patient
need not necessarily die. As there is already a wound in the
neck made by the surgeon, there would be little difficulty, by
extending it, in ascertaining that the blood came from the
brain, and that nothing but a ligature on the internal carotid
artery above the part wounded through the mouth could
save the patient; and why not do this operation at first, and
place a ligature above and another below the wound in the
artery?</p>

<p>214. It is with great satisfaction I quote the opinion of M.
Velpean on this subject, as showing the greater advance
Parisian surgeons have made than even many of high attainments
in London: “In hemorrhage from the neck, the mouth,
the throat, the ear, or the skull, everything should be done
to reach the branch of the carotid which has been wounded,
rather than tie the carotid itself.” Alluding to a wound of
the inferior pharyngeal artery, he says: “The search for
this artery will cause but little or no inconvenience, for the
same incision will suffice for the ligature of the external or
internal carotid, the lingual, the facial, or the superior thyroid
artery, if it become necessary, each artery being capable
of being taken hold of and compressed, until the one which
is really wounded is ascertained.” He further adds: “Surgeons
found it formerly more convenient and sure to tie the
primitive trunk of the carotid, for all arterial diseases of the
head, than to tie the external or internal carotid or their
branches; <i>but this is not admissible in the present day</i>.”
Operating for a tumor on the left temple, which he consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>ered
aneurismal, he first tied the common trunk of the carotid,
and then the internal. The tumor diminished in size,
but hemorrhage took place from the wound, and was frequently
repeated until the sixteenth day, when the patient
died hemiplegic. The hemorrhage came from the external
carotid, and the blood escaped through the upper opening
of the common carotid. He says himself he ought to have
tied the external carotid also; or, after the first bleeding,
have applied a ligature on the upper end of the common
trunk.</p>

<p>215. Dr. Twitchell, of Keene, N. H., United States, says
a soldier, in a sham fight, in 1807, received a wound, from
the wadding of a pistol, on the right side of the head, face,
and neck, which was much burned. A large wound was made
in the mouth and pharynx; nearly the whole of the parotid
gland, with the temporal, masseter, and pharyngeal muscles,
was destroyed. The neighboring bones were shattered, and
the tongue injured. The hemorrhage was not copious, although
the external carotid and its branches were divided.
Ten days after the accident, the sloughs had all separated,
and left a large circular aperture, of from two to three inches
in diameter, at the bottom of which might be seen distinctly
the internal carotid artery, denuded from near the bifurcation
of the common trunk to where it forms a turn to enter the
canal in the temporal bone. Directly on this part there was
a dark speck, of a line or two in diameter, which suddenly
gave way while Dr. Twitchell was in the house. With the
thumb of his left hand he compressed the artery against the
base of the skull, and effectually controlled the hemorrhage.
The patient fainted. As soon as he recovered, the doctor
says: “I proceeded to clear the wound from blood, and
having done this I made an incision with a scalpel downward,
along the course of the artery, to more than an inch
below the point where the external branch was given off,
which, as stated above, had been destroyed at the time of the
injury. Having but one hand at liberty, I depended upon
the mother of the patient to separate the sides of the wound,
which she did, partly with a hook, and occasionally with her
fingers. At length, partly by careful dissection, and partly
by using my fingers and the handle of the scalpel, I succeeded
in separating the artery from its attachments; and,
passing my finger under it, I raised it up sufficiently for my
assistant to pass a ligature round it. She tied it with a sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>geon’s
knot, as I directed, about half an inch below the bifurcation.”
Dr. Twitchell removed his thumb, and sponged
away the blood, not doubting that the hemorrhage was
effectually controlled; but, to his surprise and disappointment,
the blood immediately began to ooze from the rupture
in the artery, and in less than ten minutes it flowed with a
pulsating jet. He compressed it again with his thumb, and
began to despair of saving his patient, but resolved to make
another attempt. Raising his thumb, he placed a small
piece of dry sponge directly over the orifice in the artery,
and renewed the compression till a rather larger piece of
sponge could be prepared. He placed that upon the first,
and so went on, pressing the gradually enlarged pieces obliquely
upward and backward against the base of the skull,
till he had filled the wound with a firm cone of sponge, the
base of which projected two or three inches externally. He
then applied a linen roller in such a manner as to press firmly
upon the sponge, passing it in repeated turns over the head,
face, and neck. On the 30th of December the patient was
discharged cured, several fragments of bone and two teeth
from the upper jaw having been cast off. Some deformity
remained, in consequence of the depression on the side of the
face.</p>

<p>The inutility of tying the primitive trunk for a wound of
the internal carotid is distinctly shown in this case, which is
no less valuable from the fact demonstrated, that if the internal
carotid can be exposed and injured within the angle
of the jaw by an accident, it can be exposed and secured by
ligature at the same part by an operation.</p>

<p>216. When, then, the internal carotid is wounded through
the mouth, what operation is to be performed? That of
placing a ligature above, and another below the opening
made into it; and after much consideration, and many trials,
the following operative process is recommended to the attention
of those who are best acquainted with the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>An incision is to be begun opposite to and on the outside
of the extremity of the lobe of the ear, and carried downward
in a straight line, until it reaches a little below the angle of
the jaw, at the distance of nearly half an inch, more or less,
as may be found most convenient from the form of the neck.
This incision exposes the parotid gland without injuring it.
A second is then to be made from the extremity of the first,
extending at a right angle forward, under or along the base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the lower jaw, until the end of it is opposite the first
molar tooth. This incision should divide the skin, superficial
fascia, platysma myoides muscle, and the facial artery
and vein. The second molar tooth should then be removed,
and the jaw sawn through at that part. Then cut through
the deep fascia, the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and the mucous
membrane of the floor of the mouth, exposing the insertion
of the internal pterygoid muscle, which is to be divided.
The surgeon will next be able to raise and partially evert the
angle of the jaw, and thus obtain room for the performance
of the remaining part of the operation, which should be
effected by the pointed but blunt end of a scalpel, or other
instrument chosen for the purpose of separating, but not of
cutting. The styloid process of the temporal bone may then
be readily felt, and exposed by the separation of a little cellular
membrane, and with it the stylo-hyoid muscle, which
is to be carefully raised and divided. The external carotid
artery will thus be brought into view, together with the stylo-pharyngeus
muscle and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve attached
to it. These are to be drawn inward by a blunt hook, when,
if care be taken to avoid the pneumogastric nerve, the internal
carotid may be felt, seen, and secured by ligature with
comparative facility outside the tonsil, there being between
them the superior constrictor of the pharynx, which, in a case
of wound through the mouth, must have been divided. The
pneumogastric nerve should be drawn outward, and the external
carotid artery also, if in the way. The division of the
jaw will not lead to further inconvenience, as the bone always
reunites, when divided, with little difficulty. That this operation
requires a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the
parts, is true; and this can only be acquired by repeated dissections.</p>

<p>217. The nearest successful case to the operation thus
recommended was performed by Dr. Keith, of Aberdeen.</p>

<p>E. Kennedy, aged twenty-five, accidentally swallowed a
pin, the head of which could be felt below and behind the
left tonsil, covered by the lining membrane of the pharynx;
it could not be extracted by any attempt made for its removal.
The membrane was snipped by a pair of probe-pointed
scissors, to expose the head of the pin. This was
followed by the discharge of mouthfuls of arterial blood,
and it was evident that the internal carotid artery had been
injured. Pressure on the common carotid stopped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
bleeding, and the operation of placing a ligature on the
internal carotid was effected in the following manner: The
patient’s head being supported by a pillow, her face was
turned toward the right shoulder, when an incision was made
from below the ear along the ramus of the lower jaw to below
its angle. No hemorrhage occurred, and the vessel was
speedily exposed and secured by a double ligature passed
under it, with less difficulty than the depth of the vessel
would lead one to expect. One ligature arrested the flow of
blood, and the other was therefore withdrawn. The woman
recovered, without any return of the bleeding. Dr. Keith,
aware of the necessity for tying the other end of the artery,
if it should bleed, watched the case day and night until the
period of danger had passed away. The pin gave no trouble,
until felt by the patient as about to go down the œsophagus,
which it did to her great satisfaction and relief from further
anxiety.</p>

<p class="h2sub">LIGATURE OF THE COMMON ILIAC ARTERY, ETC.</p>

<p>218. The operation for placing a ligature on the aorta
should not be done by making an opening through the front
of the abdomen, as has hitherto been proposed. It should
in future be attempted and executed nearly in the same manner
as the operation for placing a ligature on the common
iliac, which has succeeded. The aorta bifurcates usually on
the body of the fourth, or on the inter-vertebral substance
between it and the fifth vertebra, although it may be higher
or lower&mdash;a fact which cannot be ascertained previously to
the operation; the most usual place is nearly opposite to
the margin of the umbilicus on the left side. It is about
half an inch above this that the ligature should be placed
on the aorta, if this operation is ever done again, rather
lower than higher, on account of the origin of the inferior
mesenteric artery. As the aorta is to be reached by carrying
the finger along the common iliac, the comparative situation
of that vessel is next to be estimated.</p>

<p>The length of the two common iliac arteries varies according
to the stature of the patient, and the place at which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
aorta bifurcates. The common iliacs again divide into the
external and internal iliacs, which division is usually opposite
to the sacro-iliac symphysis. The length of the common
iliac artery is therefore tolerably well defined, as scarcely ever
exceeding two inches and three-quarters, and seldom being
less than two inches. The external iliac is a little longer than
the common iliac, and the place of subdivision of the common
iliac into external and internal can always be ascertained,
during an operation, by tracing the external iliac upward
to its junction with the internal to form the common
trunk, which proceeds upward and inward to the aorta. The
left margin of the umbilicus being taken as a point opposite
to that which may be presumed to be the part at which the
aorta divides, and the situation of the external iliac becoming
femoral being clearly ascertained, a line drawn between
the two will nearly indicate the course of these two vessels;
sufficiently so, at all events, to enable the operator to mark
with his eye, or with ink, the place where he expects to tie
the artery; and to regulate the length of the incision, so
that this ideal spot may correspond to its center. It is
necessary to recollect, also, that the whole of one hand and
part of the other must be introduced into the wound, to
enable the operator to pass a ligature round the artery, and
to tie the knots: so that an external excision of less extent
than five inches will not suffice, and six will afford a facility
in operating, which will save pain to the patient and inconvenience
to the operator. In calculating the length of the
incision, allowance must be made for the size, obesity, and
muscularity of the patient. If a rule be placed on the crest
of each ilium, about one inch and a half behind the anterior
superior spinous process, it will pass in a well-formed man
across the junction of the fifth lumbar vertebra with the
upper part of the sacrum, and a little way behind where
the common iliac divides into external and internal. The
center of an incision, six inches in length, beginning about
half an inch above Poupart’s ligament, and about the same
distance to the outside of the inner ring, and carried upward,
will fall nearly on a line with this point. The incision
should be nearly parallel to the course of the epigastric
artery, but a little more to the outside, in order to avoid it
and the spermatic cord, and having a gradual inclination
inward toward the external edge of the rectus muscle; the
patient being on his back, with the head and shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
raised, and the legs bent on the trunk. The aponeurosis of
the external oblique muscle having been opened inferiorly,
is to be slit up for the whole length of the external incision;
and the director having been first passed under the internal
oblique muscle, through a small opening carefully made into
it, it is to be divided in a similar manner. The transversalis
is then to be cut through at the under part, and its tendinous
expansion divided at the upper part, the greatest precaution
being taken by the finger to prevent the peritoneum being
injured. The fascia transversalis is then to be torn through
at the lower and outer part, so that the fingers may be
passed inward from the ilium, and the peritoneum detached
from the iliac fossa, and turned with its contents inward, by
a gradual and sidelong movement of the fore and second
fingers inward and upward, until, passing over the psoas
muscle, the external iliac artery is discovered by its pulsation.
It is then to be traced upward and inward toward
the spine, when its origin and that of the internal iliac from
the common trunk will be felt. The point of the forefinger
will then be nearly in the center of a line drawn from the
umbilicus to the anterior superior spine of the ilium; hence
the necessity for an incision six inches in length, if the
artery is to be tied high up, which is to be accomplished by
tracing it in a similar manner to its origin from the aorta.</p>

<p>The <i>common trunk</i> of the iliac arteries and the <i>aorta
itself</i> may be tied by the same method of proceeding; the
only difference which can be practiced with advantage will
be to make the incision a little longer at its upper part, no
inconvenience arising from the addition to the length of the
external wound, while the subsequent steps of the operation
will be much facilitated by it. The following method of proceeding,
adopted in two cases in which I placed a ligature
on the common iliac artery with a successful result, will bring
the operation so graphically before the reader that it cannot
be misunderstood, and may be readily followed in operating:
I began the operation, the patient lying on the back, by an
incision on the fore part of the abdomen, commencing an
inch and a half below the inside of the anterior spine of the
ilium, and the same distance within it, carrying it upward,
and diagonally inward toward the edge of the rectus muscle
above the umbilicus, so that the incision was between six and
seven inches long. If the incision be made more outwardly,
toward the side in a straight or vertical line from the ilium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
toward the ribs, great difficulty will be experienced in turning
over the peritoneum with its contents, so as to place the
finger on the last lumbar vertebra&mdash;an inconvenience which
will be avoided by making the incision diagonally, and of the
length directed.</p>

<p>After dividing the common integuments, the three layers
of muscles were cut through in the most careful manner; the
division of the transversalis muscle was attended with some
difficulty, inasmuch as there was but little fascia transversalis,
and the peritoneum was remarkably thin&mdash;as thin as
white silver paper. On attempting to reach the under part
on the inside of the ilium, so as to turn the peritoneum over,
which in sound parts is always done without the least difficulty,
I found that it could not be done on account of the
tumor which projected inward adhering to it; some bleeding
took place from the large veins which surrounded it, giving
rise to the caution not to proceed further in that direction.
At this moment, in spite of the greatest possible care that
could be taken by Mr. Keate, who raised and protected the
peritoneum, a very small nick was made in it, sufficient to
show the intestine through it. Perceiving that I could not
tie the internal iliac as I had at first intended, and that I
must place the ligature on the common iliac, I tried to gain
a greater extent of space upward; but where the tendon of
the transversalis muscle passes directly across from the lower
ribs to aid in forming the sheath of the rectus, the peritoneum
is usually so thin and so closely attached to it that it can
only be separated with great difficulty. I knew this from
the operation I had before performed, when, in spite of all
the precaution I could then take, the peritoneum was at this
spot slightly opened. It occurred in the present instance,
and the right lobe of the liver was thus exposed.</p>

<p>The opening thus made on the fore part of the abdomen
was not large enough to admit two hands. The peritoneum
being, however, separated a little from the posterior wall of
the abdomen from the outside, by the fingers, for a cutting
instrument was inadmissible, four of the fingers of one hand
were introduced beneath it, and it was turned a little over
toward the opposite side. In doing this it must be remembered
that the peritoneum must be raised, the hand being
pushed toward the back as little as possible, in order to
avoid getting behind the fat commonly found in that part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the body, which would lead to the under edge of the psoas
muscle instead of the upper surface, and thus render the
operation embarrassing.</p>

<p>The peritoneum being carefully drawn over with its contents,
I found I could only get one hand, or a little more,
underneath it in search of the artery, the tumor below preventing
any further detachment of the peritoneum in that
direction. I therefore passed my finger across the psoas
muscle, and it rested on the fifth lumbar vertebra. The
common iliac artery was not to be felt, however, even as
high up as the fourth lumbar vertebra, nor was the aorta;
they had both risen with the peritoneum, and my finger
resting on the spine was beneath them. Mr. Keate endeavored
to raise or draw over the peritoneum, to give me
an opportunity of seeing the vessels, but it could not be
done. However, he felt the pulsation of the iliac artery,
which had been raised with the peritoneum, to which I
found it adhering. Carefully separating it with the end of
the forefinger of the right hand, I passed a single thread of
strong dentists’ silk, as it is termed, in a common solid
aneurismal needle, by the aid of the thumb and forefinger
of the left hand, round the artery without seeing it. I could
then bring the artery a little forward by means of the aneurismal
needle, when it appeared to be perfectly clear, and
from the distance of the bifurcation of the aorta above,
which could be distinctly felt, I calculated that the common
iliac was tied exactly at its middle part. All pulsation
below immediately ceased.</p>

<p>The two ends of the ligature were twisted, and the peritoneum
replaced in its proper situation, care being taken
that the two small openings into it should be well covered
under the skin, so that they might not be in the line of the
incision, and that they should be covered by newly divided
healthy parts, so that they might thus adhere to each other.
Three strong sutures and three or four smaller ones were
put in through the skin, in order to prevent the parts bursting
asunder from the movements of the patient. This operation
was only formidable, as a whole, from the circumstance
that space could not be obtained for the introduction of both
hands; for, strange as it may appear, the safety of and ease
in doing the operation depend on the first incision in the
fore part of the abdomen being so large that the peritoneum
containing the bowels may be freely drawn over by the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>panded
hands of the assistant, so that the operator can see
what he is doing beneath. In my first case the whole of the
parts under the peritoneum could be distinctly seen, and
several gentlemen (not in the profession) who were present
saw the common iliac artery in its natural situation.</p>

<p>The patient suffered little or nothing from the operation,
which was performed on the Saturday; there was no augmentation
of the pulse until Sunday evening, when it rose
to 120; she then experienced some pain, which was materially
diminished, although not altogether removed, by the
abstraction of fourteen ounces of blood. At four in the
morning, Mr. Hancock, now senior surgeon to the Charing
Cross Hospital, took away fourteen ounces more, after which
she had not a bad symptom. The bowels were not moved
for the first four days. The temperature of the limb diminished,
but not much, which may be attributed to its having
been constantly rubbed night and day by two persons; and
a hot brick, or bottles of hot water, covered with flannel,
having been applied to the feet, of the temperature of from
120° to 140°. One nurse rubbed the lower part of the limb,
and another the upper, for three days and three nights; if
an interval of a few minutes occurred, a hot flannel was put
on the limb. The friction was very slight, so as not to injure
the cuticle. The patient occasionally dozed a little; still the
same gentle friction was kept up. The ligature came away
on the twenty-sixth day after the operation. The external
incision healed very readily, but was followed, as is usual in
all extensive wounds of the muscular wall of the abdomen,
by a slight herniary projection, requiring the support of an
abdominal bandage.</p>

<p>The situation of the ureter and rectum on the left side in
this operation, and of the ureter and cæcum with its appendix
on the right side, should be well understood, and it should
be known that the ureter rises with the peritoneum. The
relative situation of the common iliac artery and vein should
be particularly attended to, when passing the ligature around
the vessel. On the left side, the artery lies external and anterior
to its commencement; on the right, the artery passes
over the commencement of the vena cava and the left iliac
vein, which do not follow the peritoneum when drawn toward
the opposite side. The bowels should be thoroughly well
evacuated before the operation is performed, but purgatives
should not be given for some days after it has been done.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
The food should be liquid, and inflammation should be
subdued by leeches, general bleeding, fomentations, and
opium.</p>

<p>219. The <i>aorta</i> may be as readily tied by this mode of
proceeding as the common iliac; and I am satisfied it is in
this way such an operation ought to be performed, provided
it become necessary to attempt it, which I suspect it will not
be; for when an aneurism has formed so high up that it prevents
the application of a ligature on the side on which the
disease is situated, the common iliac will be more readily tied
above it, instead of the aorta, by performing the operation
on the opposite or sound side of the body; for as a ligature
can be applied with great ease on the sound side on the
middle of the common iliac artery, it requires very little more
knowledge and dexterity to pass over to the opposite or diseased
side, and tie the artery above the aneurismal tumor,
the size of which would have prevented the operation being
done on its own or the affected side. The placing a ligature
on the aorta for an aneurism in the pelvis will thus be rendered
unnecessary&mdash;a most important result, deduced from
the operation described.</p>

<p>220. If the <i>internal iliac</i> is to be tied, the operator traces
it downward from its origin, in preference to passing his
finger from the external iliac artery inward in search of it.
Having placed the point of his forefinger on the vessel at the
part where he intends to pass his ligature, he scratches with
the nail upon and on each side of it, so as to separate it from
its cellular attachments, and from the vein which accompanies,
but lies behind it. Thus far the operator proceeds by
feeling; but it is now necessary that the sides of the wound
should be separated, and kept apart by blunt spatulæ curved
at the ends, so as to take up as little space as possible, and
not to injure the peritoneum. The surgeon should, if possible,
see the artery, and the ligature carried on the eye of a
bent probe, or a convenient aneurismal needle, should be
passed under it from within outward, when it should be
taken hold of with the forceps; the probe or needle should
then be withdrawn, and the ligature firmly tied twice, or with
a double knot. Great care must be taken to avoid everything
but the artery. The peritoneum which covers it and
the ureter which crosses it must be particularly kept in mind.
The situation of the external iliac artery and vein, which
have been crossed to reach it, must always be recollected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
and, if there be sufficient space, they should be kept out of
the way, and guarded by the finger of an assistant.</p>

<p>221. The <i>external iliac</i> artery has been so often and so
successfully tied that a description of the two methods of
proceeding commonly adopted will suffice, with a few additional
remarks. The first, recommended by Mr. Abernethy,
is in accordance with the operations on the common, and on
the internal iliac. The patient being laid on his back, with
the shoulders slightly raised, and the legs bent on the trunk,
an incision is to be made about three inches and a half in
length in the direction of the artery, terminating over or
a little above Poupart’s ligament. The aponeurosis of the
external oblique muscle will be exposed, and an opening
being made into it, a director is to be introduced, and it is
to be slit up to the extent of the external incision. The
internal oblique and transversalis muscles are then to be
“nicked,” so as to allow a director or the point of the finger
to be introduced below them, when they also are to be divided,
the finger separating them from the fascia transversalis
and the peritoneum. The fascia transversalis running from
Poupart’s ligament to the peritoneum is now to be torn
through with the nail, immediately over the pulsating artery,
and the peritoneum is to be separated by the finger, and
pushed upward until sufficient room has been obtained;
which in this, as well as in all other operations on the iliac
arteries, is sometimes difficult on account of the protrusion
of the intestines covered by the peritoneum, when the patient
is not sufficiently tranquil. The artery is yet at some depth;
it is covered by a dense cellular membrane, connecting it to
the vein on its inside, which must be torn through with the
nail. The anterior crural nerve is separated from the artery
by the psoas muscle, at the outer edge of which it lies. The
aneurismal needle should be passed between the vein and the
artery, and the point made to appear on the outside of the
latter.</p>

<p>In this operation the ligature is placed on the external
iliac, above where it gives off the epigastric and the circumflexa
ilii arteries; as the operation is very much the same as
that already described, with the exception of the incision
being shorter and nearer to Poupart’s ligament, it is obvious,
if it were found necessary from disease to tie the artery
higher up, or even to tie the common iliac, that it might
be done by merely enlarging the wound. It is therefore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
best mode of proceeding when the aneurismal swelling in the
groin has encroached on Poupart’s ligament.</p>

<p>Another method has been recommended by Sir Astley
Cooper, which is perhaps more followed where there is little
doubt of the artery being sound.</p>

<p>“The patient being placed in the recumbent posture, on
a table of convenient height, the incision is to be begun within
an inch of the anterior superior spinous process of the ilium,
and is to be extended downward in a semicircular direction
to the upper edge of Poupart’s ligament. This incision exposes
the tendon of the external oblique muscle; in the same
direction the above tendon is to be cut through, and the
lower edges of the internal oblique and transversalis abdominis
muscles exposed; the center of these muscles is then
to be raised from Poupart’s ligament; the opening by which
the spermatic cord quits the abdomen is thus exposed, and
the finger passed through this space is directly applied upon
the iliac artery, above the origin of the epigastric and circumflexa
ilii arteries. The iliac artery is placed upon the
outer side of the vein; the next step in the operation consists
in gently separating the vein from the artery by the
extremity of a director, or by the end of the finger. The
solid curved aneurismal needle is then passed under the
artery, and between it and the vein from without inward,
carrying a ligature, which, being brought out at the wound,
the needle is withdrawn, and the ligature is then tied around
the artery, as in the operation for popliteal aneurism. One
end of the ligature being cut away, the other is suspended
from the wound, the edges of which are brought together by
adhesive plaster, and the wound is treated as any other containing
a ligature.”</p>

<p>This method of operating will suffice when the artery is
to be tied for an aneurism which does not extend as high as
Poupart’s ligament. When it does, the operator will be so
much inconvenienced by it, while the sound part of the artery
above the tumor will be so much in a hollow behind it in the
pelvis, that a ligature cannot readily be passed around it;
the disturbance to the peritoneum will be much greater, and
much more likely to give rise to peritonitis, than if the incision
were made an inch longer on the face of the abdomen.
The surgeon, instead of searching for the artery, as Sir
Astley Cooper has directed, through the passage by which
the spermatic cord quits the abdomen, and thus passing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
fingers directly under the peritoneum, will find it very much
for his own ease, and for the advantage of his patient, to
pass his fingers under the peritoneum from the inside of the
wall of the ilium, from which it readily separates, and thus
approach the artery from the outside instead of from below.
He will obtain more room, reach the artery easily above the
origin of the circumflexa ilii, and avoid that disturbance of
the peritoneum, in applying the ligature, which often leads
to inflammation. The ligature should be passed under the
artery from within outward, so as to avoid the vein, which
I have seen injured by passing the needle from without
inward.</p>

<p>If the surgeon have unluckily divided the epigastric artery,
either in this or in any other operation, all that he has to do
is to enlarge the incision, and tie both ends of the divided
vessel; I have no hesitation in saying it will not be of any
consequence, either in this operation or in one for hernia.</p>

<p>222. In all cases of aneurism of the gluteal and sciatic
arteries, the internal iliac artery should be tied, instead of
an operation on the part itself. In all cases of wounds of
those arteries, which are the only ones rendering an operation
for placing a ligature on these vessels necessary, the
wound should in a great measure regulate the course of the
incision. The operation is an act of simple division, first
through the common integuments for the space of five inches,
then through and between the fibers of the gluteus muscle to
the same extent; a dense aponeurosis covering the vessels
is to be next divided, when the bleeding will lead to the
injured vessel. Place the body on the face, turn the toes
inward; commence the incision one inch below the posterior
spinous process, and one inch from the sacrum; carry it on
toward the great trochanter in an oblique direction to the
extent of five inches. Divide the gluteus muscle and the
aponeurosis beneath it, and seek for the artery as it escapes
through the upper and anterior part of the sciatic notch,
lying close to the bone. If the vessels of the gluteus muscle
bleed, so as to be troublesome, and cannot be stopped by
compression, they must be secured.</p>

<p>If the sciatic artery be the vessel injured, the incision
should be made in the same direction, but about an inch
and a half lower down. If the course of the wound render
it doubtful which artery has been injured, the incision should
be as nearly as possible between the two lines directed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
wound being always the best guide; care should be taken
in every instance to include nothing in the ligature but the
artery.</p>

<p>Dr. Tripler, of the United States Army, was called to a
person who had fallen backward with great force on a glass
bottle, which had thus been driven into the right buttock,
within an inch of the ischiatic notch. The fingers passed
into the wound could be felt on the inside of the thigh. The
man was deluged with blood, and in a state of syncope. The
wound was plugged and bandages applied. Several hemorrhages
took place, and on the thirteenth, five days after the
receipt of the injury, the wound was enlarged, and the gluteal
artery tied as it emerged from the pelvis. The bleeding
ceased for three hours, when it returned with as much force
as ever. After various ineffectual attempts to suppress the
bleeding by pressing on the external iliac and femoral arteries,
it was determined to tie the internal iliac, which was
done in a very satisfactory manner, and the bleeding did not
return. The man died three days after the operation, and
an examination after death took place; but, strange to say,
no notice is taken, no mention whatever is made of the
wounded vessel. It is simply remarked that the last ligature
was found embracing the internal iliac artery an inch
below the bifurcation, and a firm coagulum already deposited
above the point of ligation.</p>

<p>According to the principles laid down in this work, two
errors were committed in this case. The first, in tying the
gluteal artery <i>as it emerged from the pelvis</i>. The second,
in tying the internal iliac, which was unnecessary. The
bleeding which caused this operation to be resorted to is
described <i>as a welling up of the vital fluid</i>, as returning
<i>slowly and sluggishly</i>; the color is not alluded to. It is
probable that the gluteal artery was not divided, but only
wounded; and if the injured part had been sought for, and
one ligature applied above, and another below the wound
in it, the hemorrhage would not have returned, and life
perhaps might not have been lost.</p>

<p>The operations were highly honorable to the gentlemen
concerned, as proving their anatomical knowledge. The
principle on which they acted I presume to condemn.</p>

<p>223. Compression should never be made on the femoral
artery when a ligature is about to be placed upon it for
aneurism, because the pulsation is thereby suppressed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the most important guide to the vessel is at the same time
taken away. When the artery has been wounded near the
groin, and is bleeding, compression must be had recourse
to in the first instance to arrest the hemorrhage; the first
incisions must therefore be made without the information
which the pulsation gives as to the precise situation of the
artery, although a finger may be allowed to rest, or a mark
be made on the part, beneath which the artery could be felt
before the pressure was applied. The external incision
should always be made longer or shorter in proportion to
the depth at which the artery is situated. It should be at
least one-third longer in the middle than at the upper part
of the thigh; for, while a long incision always facilitates the
subsequent steps of the operation, it never does harm, unless
it is out of all reasonable proportion. The center of the
incision should be, if possible, directly over that part of the
artery on which it is intended to apply the ligature; but no
inconvenience will arise from its being applied nearer its
upper extremity. The patient being laid on his back, and
properly supported, the knee is to be bent and turned outward,
by which the head of the femur will be rolled in the
acetabulum, and the femoral artery will be more distinctly
felt at the upper part of the thigh, below Poupart’s ligament.
It lies on the psoas muscle, having the vein on its
inside, and the anterior crural nerve about half an inch on
its outside, having passed between the psoas and iliacus
muscles, although some branches soon approach the artery,
and run down on the external part of the sheath. The relative
position of the parts having been duly considered, an
incision is to be made <i>directly</i> in a line over the pulsating
artery, and carried through the skin, cellular tissue, and
superficial fascia, down to the deep-seated or fascia lata of
the thigh. If an absorbent gland should be in the way, it
must be turned aside or removed. The arteria profunda
femoris is given off about two inches below Poupart’s ligament,
on the back part of and outside the femoral, while
three or four small vessels spring from half an inch to an
inch below it on the fore part, and one or other of these
may be divided. They are the superficial epigastric, the
superficial pudic, the superficial circumflex of the ilium, and
probably an artery supplying the absorbent glands. If they
bleed so as to be troublesome, they must be secured, more
particularly if the femoral artery is to be tied below them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
The fascia lata is now to be divided, with that part of the
fascia transversalis which, descending beneath Poupart’s ligament,
forms the sheath of the artery, when the vessel will be
exposed. In dividing this fascia and sheath, the point of
the knife is always to be directed to the center of the artery,
so that if it be cut by accident it may be seen, when the only
result will be the necessity for the application of a ligature
above and one below it. The artery being fully exposed, as
ascertained by the pulsation being felt by the finger, it is to
be separated from its cellular attachment to the sheath on
each side by a blunt or silver knife; and the aneurismal
needle or probe, armed with a strong single thread of dentists’
silk, is to be passed under it from the inner or pubic
side outward, by which all injury to the vein from the round
point of the needle or probe will be avoided. Two common
knots are to be made in the usual manner, when one thread
may be cut off, or the two twisted together and brought
carefully out of the wound; the edges of which are then to
be duly approximated and retained in that situation by sticking-plaster
and a moderate compress, secured in a similar
manner. The knee is to be bent forward to relax the parts,
and laid on the outside with a pillow beneath it.</p>

<p>The needle will pass more easily under the artery if the
thigh be bent on the trunk; before the knots are tied, the
surgeon should ascertain that pressure on the part or artery,
which he has nearly surrounded by the ligature, suppresses
the pulsation in the tumor below.</p>

<p>224. The point of a sword entering the anterior part of
the thigh two inches below Poupart’s ligament, and wounding
the superficial femoral artery, will necessitate the application
of two ligatures, one above and the other below the
wound in the vessel; but as the profunda under ordinary
circumstances is given off posteriorly at this spot, it is possible
the upper ligature may be placed on the main artery a
little above the bifurcation. The result might, and would
probably be, on some sudden movement of the patient, a
recurrence of the hemorrhage by regurgitation from the
profunda into the main trunk below the ligature; and thus
through the wound in the artery, the lower ligature assisting
by the obstacle it offers to the passage of blood through it.
In such a case, the wound should be reopened, and the profunda
sought for and tied. It has been argued that the
ligatures, being applied close to the origin of collateral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
branches, must fail. This error has been demonstrated,
(Aph. 186,) and need not be further insisted upon. That
it should still be maintained by some surgeons and teachers,
who prefer old jog-trot theories to demonstrated facts, and
cannot perceive that an exception is not a fundamental rule,
is much to be regretted.</p>

<p>225. The operation for popliteal aneurism lower down in
the thigh is to be done in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>The surgeon, having turned the knee outward and bent
the leg inward into the tailor’s sitting position, to show the
course of the sartorius muscle, should trace the artery from
the groin downward, until it appears to pass under that
muscle. The external incision, four inches in length, made
in the course of the artery, should pass over this point one
inch, so that when the fascia lata is divided, the sartorius
muscle may be seen crossing over to the inside at the lower
extremity of the wound. The fascia lata is to be divided
upward for the space of two inches of the incision. The
forefinger is then to be introduced into the wound, and
pressure made with it rather outwardly, when it will readily
distinguish the pulsation of the artery, still included in its
sheath. This is to be opened by slight and repeated touches
of the knife directly over the center of the line of the vessel,
or it may be divided on the director, when the artery will be
exposed. The point of the forefinger will easily recognize
it from the roundness and firmness of the feeling communicated
by it, as well as by its pulsation; and the end of the
nail, or handle of the scalpel or blunt knife, will separate it
with facility from its attachments, to such an extent as to
admit the blunt point of the solid, unyielding aneurism
needle to be passed beneath it from the pubic side. If the
point of the needle do not readily come through the cellular
attachments of the artery on the outside, this part must be
touched lightly with the scalpel, or rubbed with the nail
until the ligature is exposed, which should then be taken
hold of with the forceps and one end drawn out, while the
instrument with the other end is withdrawn. The operator,
taking both ends of the ligature, which has been in this
manner passed under the artery, between the fingers of one
hand, presses upon the artery with the forefinger of the
other, so as to arrest the course of the blood in it, when, if
there be an aneurism blow, the pulsation in it will cease.
The ligature is then to be pressed upward as far as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
artery has been detached, and is to be tied with a double
knot. The wound is to be dressed as in the previous case
with adhesive plaster and compress, but without a bandage;
and the patient is to be placed in bed, with his knee bent
forward, or resting on the outside, if more agreeable to
him.</p>

<p>The operation is done in this manner on that part of the
femoral artery which is not covered by muscle, and all interference
with the sartorious is avoided. It is the improvement
on the Hunterian operation recommended by Scarpa,
and ought always to be adopted. This method obviates all
discussion as to placing the ligature on the outside of the
sartorious muscle, or as to the fear of injuring the absorbents;
as to the saphena vein, it can always be seen, and its
course traced up the thigh and avoided. After the first incision
has been made and completed down to the fascia lata,
that part is to be divided to the extent of two inches, but
this must be dependent on circumstances; the object being
to obtain a view of the sheath containing the artery, the
opening into which, after the first touch of the knife, may be
completed with the assistance of the director under it. The
artery will be less disturbed in its lateral attachments by an
opening into the sheath, of three-quarters of an inch in
length, than by one of half the extent, as it will admit of
the aneurism needle being passed under it with more facility,
and consequently with less disturbance to the surrounding
parts. There is no reason to believe that a free opening
into the fascia of the thigh has ever done mischief, or even
one made in the sheath, provided the artery has not been
unnecessarily disturbed.</p>

<p>The warmth of the limb operated upon should be maintained
by gentle friction from the toes upward to the knee;
when left at rest it should be enveloped in flannel. The
wound should not be dressed until the fourth day, the limb
being kept quite quiet; the patient should move as little as
possible in bed, and the part of the heel on which the limb
rests should be examined from time to time, as it may under
pressure become gangrenous.</p>

<p>Suppression of the secretion of urine is not uncommon
during the first twenty-four hours after all these operations;
it may be gradually removed by the patient’s taking mild
diluent drinks. The constitutional irritation is frequently
great, the pulse rising in forty-eight hours from 85 to 120;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
if this continue until the third day, when the fear of mortification
will have passed away, it should be moderated by the
abstraction of a small quantity of blood. In some cases of
this kind I have had occasion to bleed twice, and with the
happiest effect, the pulse having fallen in consequence to its
natural standard. The medicines given at the same time
were saline draughts every six hours, with from four to six
or more drops of Battley’s solution of opium. The ligatures
come away on and about the fifteenth day. In many cases
they remain a much longer time without inconvenience.</p>

<p>226. The popliteal artery is never to be secured by ligature,
unless wounded and bleeding. Under ordinary circumstances,
an incision should be made at least three inches
long in the course of the wound, the patient being laid on
his face and the limb extended. If the injury to the artery
has been committed where it lies in the ham between the
heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, the bleeding and the
pulsation will point out its situation. The integuments and
fascia having been divided, the posterior saphena vein and
nerve, if seen, are to be avoided and drawn aside, when, by
carefully separating some dense cellular or areolar membrane
and drawing the heads of the gastrocnemius from each other,
the bleeding artery will be seen as well as the vein and nerve.
The nerve should be drawn inward with a blunt hook and
the vein carefully drawn outward.</p>

<p>“On the 2d of February, 1855, a young gentleman, aged
nineteen, had a heavy mortising chisel thrown at him, which
entered the upper part of the calf of the leg. There was
arterial bleeding, which a man near him stopped by keeping
his finger on the wound. I saw him two hours after the accident;
there was bleeding ‘per saltum;’ presumed that the
posterior tibial was cut. Consulting with two other surgeons,
he was turned over on the table; the limb was distended,
and a firm clot filled up the cavity; I pressed moderately
upon either side of the wound, but there was no return of
hemorrhage. The patient was therefore put to bed, a bandage
applied, and an assistant left in charge. The day following
there was less tension in the calf; no hemorrhage.
Having recently read a case by Butcher, in the ‘Dublin
Quarterly,’ upon the treatment of wounded arteries by compression,
I followed out his rules. The case did well up to
February 13th, when he had a sudden and severe pain in the
calf of the leg, which was much distended, and the clot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
pulsating strongly. In a few minutes a large stream burst
out, so large that I was satisfied it could not be from the
posterior tibial. I put my finger in the sinus and found
that its direction was first backward, then backward and upward.
I again proposed to dilate the wound and search for
the vessel, when an objection was started by one of my
friends, that if the artery were wounded immediately on its
division, there would not be sufficient space for the clot to
form. As this objection was made, and I failed to combat
it, I summoned the consulting surgeon of the district. After
carefully considering the case, he strongly advised a fair trial
should still be given to compression. Hemorrhage returned
upon the 16th. A consultation advised ligature of the femoral
artery, which operation I did. Bleeding returned on the 25th,
and on the 26th I cut down and found a small slit in the popliteal,
and put a ligature above and below it, which saved the
life of the patient.”</p>

<p>227. The posterior tibial, or the peroneal artery, or both,
if wounded at the same time, are to be tied according to
the principles laid down in Aphorism 197, page 231. An
incision, from six to seven inches long, should be made nearer
to the inner edge of the leg than to the center, and should
be carried through the gastrocnemius muscle, the plantaris
tendon, and soleus muscle, down to the deep fascia, under
which the arteries lie with their accompanying veins, having
the posterior tibial nerve on the fibular side of the artery.
If the incision has been made in the upper part of the calf
of the leg, the peroneal artery will be exposed by it; but if
it be certain that the peroneal artery is the vessel injured,
the incision should be made toward the fibular side of the
leg. When the surgeon has divided the fascia, he will find
this artery covered by the fleshy fibers of the flexor longus
pollicis muscle, at any distance below three inches and a half
from the head of the fibula; these fibers being divided, the
artery will be found close to the inside of the bone. Above
that part the artery is under the fascia, and upon the tibialis
posticus muscle. It has not an accompanying nerve. Both
arteries will be readily found by either of the incisions, if the
surgeon be acquainted with their situation.</p>

<p>The posterior tibial artery may require to be tied between
the ankle and the heel. In this situation its pulsation may
be felt, and that will be the best guide to the artery. It has
the tendons of the tibialis anticus, and of the flexor digitorum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
communis, nearer to the malleolus than itself, and distant
about a quarter of an inch; there is a vein on each side of
the artery. Posterior to this is the posterior tibial nerve,
and nearer the heel the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis.
To tie the artery near the heel, its pulsation should be felt,
and an incision more than two inches long made upon it,
through the common integuments and superficial fascia; a
strong aponeurosis will be found beneath, covering the
sheath of the vessels and adhering to the tendons. This
aponeurosis must be carefully opened on a director passed
beneath it, and then the sheath of the vessels: the artery
should be tied with a single ligature, unless wounded. The
nerve is nearer the heel.</p>

<p>The posterior tibial artery may be tied a couple of inches
higher up in the small part of the leg, by making the incision
on the tibial edge of the soleus muscle, under which it
lies.</p>

<p>228. The posterior tibial artery, an inch and a quarter or
from that to an inch and a half below the inner ankle, gives
off the internal plantar artery, and assumes the name of
external plantar. The internal and smaller artery passes
forward on the inside of the foot, under the origin of the
abductor pollicis, to the outer or metatarsal side of the great
toe.</p>

<p>The external plantar artery, from the point of division,
takes a course curved toward the heel to the metatarsal bone
of the little toe, which is prominent, being a distance of
about three inches; during this course it is covered by the
integuments, lateral ligament of the joint, a quantity of granular
fat, the thick plantaris fascia, the origin of the abductor
of the great toe, and the flexor brevis of the other toes.
The artery may then be felt and seen near the os calcis,
having the nerve and vein to the inner side; and lying on
the accessorius muscle and its fascia, at the depth, in ordinary
cases, of about an inch and a half. The plantar fascia
extends in considerable strength from the os calcis forward
to the toes, and divides into two portions opposite the first
phalanx of each, which are inserted laterally into the sheaths
of the flexor tendons, and the sides of the ligaments connecting
the phalanges to the metatarsal bones. This fascia
should, when necessary, be slit up at the part injured, or a
bent probe forcibly passed under it to the required extent,
when any intervening muscular fibers should be divided until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the bleeding point is perceived, when a ligature above and
another below the wound should be placed upon the artery.</p>

<p>The external plantar artery, on reaching the metatarsal
bone of the little toe, runs forward, in nearly a straight line,
between the middle and outer divisions of the plantar fascia,
the section of which will expose it as far forward as the end
of the metatarsal bone.</p>

<p>229. The anterior tibial artery is to be tied at that part
of its course at which it may be wounded. When the operation
is done for aneurism, it should be performed a short
distance above the tumor, and sometimes a second operation
below it will become necessary. If the aneurism should be
situated so high up and so close to the origin of the vessel
as not to admit of a ligature being applied anterior to the
interosseous ligament, it may be placed on the femoral artery
of the thigh, and the result awaited. If it appeared likely
to succeed at first, and yet the pulsation returned, the artery
should be tied below the tumor, because the return of pulsation
would probably depend on the blood regurgitating into
the vessel.</p>

<p>In order to tie the anterior tibial artery after it has passed
from the back to the fore part of the leg through the interosseous
space, and over the interosseous ligament, and for
one-third of its descent toward the instep, draw a line from
the head of the fibula to the base of the great toe, which
will nearly describe its course. An incision four inches in
length is to be made in this line down to the fascia covering
the muscles; if the foot be bent upward, and again extended,
the bellies of the tibialis anticus and extensor digitorum
communis muscles will be more distinctly seen. The fascia
is to be divided for the whole length of the incision between
them; they are then to be separated for the same distance
by the scalpel and the finger; the artery will be found close
on the interosseous ligament, between its two venæ comites.</p>

<p>A case has been supposed, in which a knife, a sword, or
other narrow instrument, having penetrated the upper part
of the leg, has wounded the anterior tibial artery just after
it has been given off from the posterior tibial, behind the interosseous
space or ligament. The bleeding is free, and from
the wound in the front of the leg, although the artery cannot
be secured, from the narrowness of the space between the
tibia and fibula, behind which space it is situated. This very
peculiar injury, which may, however, occur at any time, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>not
be known until an incision has been made on the fore
part of the leg, and the bleeding point seen so deep between
the bones as not to admit of two ligatures being placed on
the artery above and below it. In such a case, an incision
is to be made through the calf of the leg, when the artery
can be secured without difficulty. No great inconvenience,
it is apprehended, would result from the two operations. If
the sword wound should have been a small one, although
deep, compression on its surface would in all probability
have been had recourse to in the first instance; which, while
it prevented the flow of blood externally, would scarcely impede
its effusion above the fascia and under the soleus muscle,
the distention of which and of the calf of the leg would,
to a careful observer, point out the evil, and lead to the operation
being done in the first instance through the calf of the
leg.</p>

<p>In the middle third of the leg the origin of the extensor
proprius pollicis intervenes between the tibialis anticus and
the extensor communis digitorum muscles. The anterior
tibial nerve, a branch of the peroneal, attaches itself to the
artery a little above this middle part, and is usually found in
front of it, although it is not constantly in that situation:
care should always be taken to avoid it.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the leg the artery lies on the tibia,
having the tendons of the extensor digitorum communis on
the outside, and that of the extensor proprius pollicis on the
inside, by which it is overlapped, being also covered by the
fascia and the integuments.</p>

<p>On the instep this artery runs over the astragalus, the
naviculare, and the os cuneiforme internum, to the base of the
metacarpal bone supporting the great toe. It here divides
into two branches: one dips down between the first and
second metatarsal bones, to join the terminating branch of
the external plantar artery, rendering the collateral circulation
free; the other passes on to the inside of the great, and
the opposite sides of the first and second toes. The artery
is always to be found on the fibular side of the tendon of the
extensor proprius pollicis.</p>

<p class="h2sub">THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY, ETC.</p>

<p>230. The carotid artery may be tied, in almost any part
of its course, in the following manner: The patient being
seated, with the shoulders supported, so that the light may
fall on the neck, the head is to be bent a little forward, to
relax the muscles on the fore part. An incision is then to
be made on the line of the inner edge of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus
muscle, by which the integuments, the platysma
myoides, and the superficial cervical fascia are to be divided.
The extent of this incision, in persons with long necks, may
be from a line beginning parallel with the cricoid cartilage
to within about half an inch of the sternal end of the clavicle:
when the neck is very short, it must be begun as high up as
the lower edge of the thyroid cartilage, so as to be as nearly
as possible three inches in length. The sterno-cleido-mastoideus
muscle is then to be drawn outward, with any vein
which may be seen attached to its under edge. The pulsation
of the artery under the finger will point out its situation,
and the sterno-hyoideus and sterno-thyroideus muscles being
drawn and kept inward, the omo-hyoideus will be seen crossing
in the upper part of the hollow thus formed by the
separation of these parts. The central tendinous portion of
this muscle is attached and fixed by the deep cervical fascia,
and lies immediately over the sheath of the vessels, particularly
over the jugular vein. This fascia, which is strong
although thin, is to be carefully divided below the muscle,
immediately over the center of the artery, the position of
which is to be accurately ascertained by the finger. At or
beneath the same spot, the sheath of the artery is to be
opened; and the long, thin nerve, the descendens noni, which
runs upon the sheath, will at this part be seen inclining to
the tracheal side of the artery. It is to be separated and
drawn inward with the muscles. If the sheath of the artery
be carefully opened immediately over its center, the jugular
vein will scarcely interfere with it. But as it has been known
to enlarge suddenly under the exertions or excitement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
patient so as to overlap the artery, it has been recommended
to make gentle pressure on the vessel at the upper part of
the incision, and below if necessary, in order to prevent that
occurrence. The aneurismal needle is then to be introduced
and passed under the artery from without inward, by which
the jugular vein and the par vagum nerve will be avoided,
more particularly if the sheath of the vessels has been undisturbed,
save where it has been opened immediately over the
artery. The point of the aneurismal needle is to be brought
out close to the inside of the artery within its sheath, by
which means all danger will be avoided of injuring either
the recurrent or the sympathetic nerves which lie behind or
to the inside of it. As to the œsophagus, thoracic duct, or
thyroid artery, they are not likely to be injured by any common
operator; but he should be aware that on the left side, if
he be obliged to operate low down, he may meet with greater
inconvenience from the jugular vein, which is more anterior
to the artery, and rather overlaps it, while on the right side
it inclines outward from it.</p>

<p>The carotid artery may be tied higher up in the following
manner: The incision in this instance should be begun a
little below where the former one was commenced, and
should be continued upward for the same length of three
inches, in a line extending toward the angle of the jaw.
The head should be laid back to enable this to be done, and
ought to be kept in that position by an assistant. The
artery at this part of the neck is covered by the integuments,
the platysma myoides muscle, and the fascia. After the
muscle has been divided, the strong fascia must be carefully
raised with the forceps and opened, and the operator will do
wisely if he divide it upward and downward on a director.
With the end of the scalpel or a blunt knife he should separate
the cellular tissue from the veins, which appear in this
situation, and are often the source of much embarrassment.
The sheath of the artery is to be opened over the center of
the vessel, and the ligature is to be passed around it as before.
The descendens noni nerve runs in general on the
outside of the artery in this part of the neck, and afterward
crosses over to the tracheal side. The par vagum,
which lies in the angle formed posteriorly by the apposition
of the carotid artery and jugular vein, to which latter it is
more particularly attached, is to be avoided on introducing
the aneurismal needle; and on bringing it out on the inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the same attention must be paid to prevent injury to the
great sympathetic or any of its branches. The surgeon in
both these operations should draw the ligature first a little
outward and then inward, so as to enable him to ascertain
that he has included in it nothing but the artery, which is to
be tied with two knots; one end may be cut off, or both may
be twisted together, and brought out of the wound opposite
where the vessel has been tied. The integuments should be
accurately closed by adhesive plaster, and the patient put to
bed with the head bent forward, and properly supported.
He should eat as little solid food as possible until after the
ligatures have come away, and observe even greater precautions
as to quietude than in other instances.</p>

<p>231. The external carotid artery may be tied by an
operation conducted in a similar manner. After the first
incisions have been made, and the strong cervical fascia
divided, the operator must feel for the pulsating vessel,
which will be found on a line parallel with the cornu of the
os hyoides, below which part the common trunk usually
divides into the external and internal carotids, the external
being the more superficial and internal of the two at their
origin. The external carotid turns with its convexity inward;
nearly opposite to but rather above the os hyoides it
is crossed by the ninth or lingual nerve, the digastric and
stylo-hyoid muscles; it should be tied below this part.</p>

<p>When any of the branches of the external carotid has
been wounded, it ought to be tied by a similar operation at
both ends, at the part wounded. If the surgeon cannot do
this, and the hemorrhage demand it, the trunk of the external
carotid is the vessel on which the ligature should be
placed, not that of the common carotid.</p>

<p>232. The internal carotid artery, when wounded near the
bifurcation of the common carotid, is to be secured by two
ligatures, and the steps in the operation are the same as
those for exposing the external carotid, the surgeon recollecting
that the internal carotid is more deeply seated and
to the outside of the external. A ligature may be placed
on the internal or external carotid, close to the bifurcation,
with safety; but if the wound of either vessel should encroach
on the bifurcation, one ligature should be applied on
the common trunk and another above the part wounded; but
as neither of these would control the collateral circulation
through the <i>uninjured</i> vessel, whichever of the two it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
might be, a third ligature should be placed on it above
the bifurcation.</p>

<p>When the internal carotid is wounded through the mouth,
at the upper part of the neck, it should be secured by the
operation described on page 248, Aph. 216.</p>

<p>233. The arteria innominata arises from the upper part
of the arch of the aorta, generally on a line nearly parallel
with the upper edge of the cartilage of the second rib,
ascends obliquely toward the right side, and usually divides
opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation into the right
subclavian and the right carotid arteries; the last of which
appears to be its continuation, although the smaller in size.
The arteria innominata is about two inches in length, rarely
exceeding two inches and a half, although it is very variable
both in length and situation, so much so as sometimes to
render the operation of placing a ligature upon it during
life impracticable. It is covered by the right vena innominata,
which receives the left at a right angle, near the
origin of the artery. Exterior to the vena innominata are
the sterno-thyroideus and sterno-hyoideus muscles, some
strong fascia covering the vein at its upper part, and the
first bone of the sternum. The arteria innominata may
ascend higher in the neck before it divides, in which case its
pulsation will be perceptible in front of the trachea, and the
subclavian artery will cross higher in the neck, which is one
reason for not continuing the external incision down to the
sterno-clavicular articulation in the operation on the right
carotid. The subclavian artery, given off behind or a little
above the articulation, proceeds outwardly for the space of
one inch before it reaches the inner edge of the scalenus
anticus muscle, which is about half an inch in width; so
that the subclavian artery, when it clears the outer edge of
the scalenus anticus muscle in a tall man, is not more than
one inch and a half or three-quarters from its origin, even
to the spot at which a ligature is usually placed upon it.
The first branch given off is the vertebral on the upper and
back part of the artery, distant half an inch from the carotid
at the bifurcation. The thyroid axis is given off at the
anterior and upper part of the artery, a quarter of an inch
more outwardly, and the internal mammary often arises
directly opposite from the anterior and inferior part of the
artery, descending into the chest behind the junction of the
first and second ribs with their cartilages. The inner edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of the scalenus anticus muscle is close to these two last vessels.
The phrenic nerve, crossing this muscle obliquely, lies
on the outside of the thyroid axis, and on the inside of the
internal mammary artery; having crossed the subclavian
artery at this part, it descends between it and the junction
of the internal jugular and subclavian veins to the chest.
Internal to this, some small branches of the great sympathetic
nerve, which lies behind, pass over the artery; and
still more internal, but distant about a quarter of an inch
from the carotid artery, the par vagum crosses likewise.
The only point at which the subclavian artery can be tied
internal to the edge of the scalenus anticus muscle is at this
point, on the inside of the par vagum, in a space scarcely
more than one-quarter of an inch in width, to which the
carotid will be the best guide. It would appear that a
ligature may be as readily applied around the innominata,
immediately below the bifurcation, as around the subclavian,
although little or no reliance can be placed on success attending
either operation.</p>

<p>From this view of the parts it will be evident that the
operation may be done in the following manner: Raise the
shoulders of the patient, and allow the head to fall backward,
by which the artery will be drawn a little from within
the chest. Let an incision be made over and down to the
sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscle, the sternal origin of which,
and nearly the whole of the clavicular origin, should be
divided on a director, carefully introduced below it, avoiding
some small veins which run below and parallel with its
origin. An incision is now or previously to be made, two
inches in length, through the integuments, along the inner
edge of the muscle, which will admit of its being raised and
turned upward and outward. Some cellular texture being
torn through, the sterno-hyoideus muscle is brought into
view, and should be divided on a director. The sterno-thyroideus
is then to be cut through in a similar manner.
A strong fascia and some cellular texture here cover the
artery, having the nerves above mentioned running beneath
it, the carotid being to the inside, the internal jugular vein
to the outside. By following the carotid downward, the
finger will rest on the innominata and on the origin of the
subclavian, and a ligature may be placed on either. If on
the innominata, the aneurismal needle (and several kinds
should be at hand) should be passed from without inward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
immediately below the bifurcation, close to the vessel. If
on the subclavian, the surgeon must recollect that there is
only about a quarter of an inch of this artery on which the
ligature can be applied; this small space being bounded
internally by the carotid artery, and externally by the par
vagum above, and the vertebral artery below. The ligature
should be applied close to the vertebral artery, the needle
being passed from below upward, the greatest care being
taken to avoid the recurrent nerve, which separates from the
par vagum at this part, and winds under the subclavian and
carotid arteries, to be continued upward to the larynx. If
the ligature be placed on the arteria innominata, the same
care must be taken to draw the par vagum outward, and to
avoid the recurrent nerve. The edges of the wound should
be brought together and dressed in the usual manner, the
head being bent forward on the trunk, and maintained in
that position, in order to relax the parts, and admit of their
being kept in apposition.</p>

<p>This operation ought only to be performed in cases of
aneurism of the subclavian artery, in which it is presumed
that the disease extends as far as the external edge of the
scalenus anticus muscle, but not more inwardly. The arteria
innominata has certainly been tied five, if not six times in
vain, and in two or three other instances the attempt failed,
the operator not succeeding in his object. In Dr. Mott’s
case the ligature came away on the fourteenth day, but the
patient died from hemorrhage, in consequence of ulceration
of the artery, on the twenty-sixth day after the operation.
Dr. Graëfe’s patient also died from hemorrhage on the sixty-seventh
day. It is evident, from these cases, that a man
may live so long after the operation as to show that he does
not die from its immediate effects, or from any that must
necessarily take place. It is therefore possible that if the
operation be often repeated it may eventually be successful.</p>

<p>234. The left subclavian artery rises perpendicularly out
of the chest like the innominata, but on a plane much posterior
to it, so that at the part where the vertebral artery is
given off, which is about an inch and a half from the origin
of the artery, it lies nearly an inch deeper from the surface
than the vessel on the opposite side. It is covered by, or is
more directly connected with, the important parts which are
also in the vicinity of the right subclavian. The pleura adheres
to it, and can scarcely avoid being torn in putting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
ligature around it. The par vagum is parallel with and
anterior to it. The internal jugular vein and the left vena
innominata lie over it. The thoracic duct and œsophagus
are connected with it; and the carotid artery is in front.
So that with the most careful dissection it is not a very easy
matter to place a ligature upon the ascending portion of the
left subclavian artery, without doing more mischief than is
compatible with the life of the patient.</p>

<p>Aneurisms of the arch of the aorta have been sometimes
known to appear so far beyond the outer edge of the scalenus
anticus muscle as to impress the surgeon with the idea
that they arose from the subclavian artery, and that an
operation on that vessel might be attended with success.
This error is not likely, however, to occur in the present day,
for the stethoscope will always point out the existence of
such an aneurism within the chest, and will therefore demonstrate
the impropriety of the operation. Aneurisms of
this nature are usually attended by some circumstances indicating
their more internal origin, independently of the information
derived from the stethoscope. An operation
should only be attempted when the case is free from doubt.</p>

<p>Whenever an aneurismal tumor in the neck is accompanied
by any alteration of the sterno-clavicular articulation,
the case is clearly one totally unfitted for any operation.
The same may be said of any case of aneurismal
swelling, either internal or external to it, in which the stethoscope
applied on the sternum in the course of the arteria
innominata, or of the arch of the aorta, indicates disease.
A swelling at the root of the carotid is more likely to be an
aneurism of the arch of the aorta, or of the arteria innominata,
than of the carotid itself. The stethoscope will remove
all doubt.</p>

<p>235. The subclavian artery has been frequently tied above
the clavicle, <i>external</i> to the scalenus anticus muscle. It
should be done in the following manner: The patient being
placed horizontally on the table, in such a situation that the
light may be directed into the hollow in the bottom of which
the artery is to be tied, the shoulder is to be depressed, and
an incision made along the edge of the clavicle, commencing
one inch nearer the sternum than the clavicular edge of the
sterno-cleido-mastoideus muscle, and carried outward to the
extent of three inches and a half or four inches. The platysma
myoides and the superficial fascia are to be divided,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
taking care not to injure the external jugular vein, which
should be drawn to the outer side of the wound. By this
incision the edges of the trapezius and sterno-cleido-mastoideus
muscles will be exposed.</p>

<p>The object of the operation is in the first instance to
reach the outer edge of the anterior scalenus muscle: this
lies immediately below the outer edge of the clavicular portion
of the sterno-cleido-mastoideus, and the division of a
portion of this part of the muscle will greatly facilitate the
subsequent steps of the operation, although it may be done
without it. The artery will be found crossing over the first
rib at the very edge of the attachment of the scalenus anticus
to it; but a quantity of cellular substance and fascia intervenes,
which must be torn through before it can be exposed.
This should be done with a blunt, round-pointed knife, in a
line parallel with the first incision, but more immediately
over the outer edge of the scalenus muscle. The omo-hyoideus
muscle passing obliquely across the root of the
neck will be in this manner exposed, which should be clearly
done, because it narrows the space in which the operation is
to be performed to a small triangle; the outside and apex
of which is formed by this muscle, the inside by the scalenus
anticus, the base by the rib, above it the subclavian vein,
and above it again, but under the clavicle, the supra-scapular
artery and vein. The blunt knife, working in the triangular
space, will first expose one or more of the nerves
of the axillary plexus, which again diminishes the space;
more inwardly the scalenus anticus will be felt, and should
be seen by tearing through the thin fascia which lies behind
the omo-hyoideus, and is connected with it. The point of
the finger, assisted if necessary by the blunt knife, should be
passed along the edge of the muscle until it rests on the first
rib, and at the angle formed between the muscle and the rib
the artery will be found and known by its pulsation. The
operator should detach the artery in a slight degree from its
connections, with the nail of the forefinger, and the aneurismal
needle should be passed in preference from below upward,
by which the pleura will be avoided. After the ligature
has been passed under the artery, the vessel should be
pressed upon with the finger, while the ligature is firmly
held in the other hand, by which the circulation through the
artery will be stopped. The pulsation in the tumor and at
the wrist should cease, when the ligature may be tied with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
double knot; for doing this, one or two steel probes, having
a ring at the end, placed at a right angle with the shaft,
will afford great assistance.</p>

<p>In some instances, particularly in short-necked persons,
the omo-hyoideus lies close to the clavicle, and requires to
be drawn upward and outward from it. In others, the
lowest nerve of the axillary plexus lies over the artery, and
may be mistaken for it. When the veins coming from the
neck are large and numerous, great care should be taken to
avoid injuring them, as they frequently cause not only much
hemorrhage, but great delay. Great care must also be
taken in all these operations to prevent the ingress of air
into any of the veins which may by accident be opened, as
its admission in quantity has occasioned sudden death,
although the entrance of a few bubbles may not be so dangerous
as has been supposed.</p>

<p>236. When the axillary artery is to be tied for a <i>wound</i>
caused by a sharp-pointed or other instrument which has
been forced through the pectoral muscle or under it from
the axilla, the patient is to be firmly supported or placed in
the horizontal position, the arm to be slightly separated
from the body, and an incision made in the course of the
axillary artery, through the integuments, superficial fascia,
and the great pectoral muscle&mdash;in fact, through the anterior
fold of the armpit. The length of the incision will depend
on the part at which the artery is to be secured. The parts
divided being separated, the pectoralis minor will be seen
crossing to the coracoid process at the upper part of the
wound, and the artery may be felt below it, inclosed in its
cellular sheath, with the nerves of the arm and its venæ
comites. All other modes of attempting this operation are
unworthy consideration, and ought to be discarded as dangerous
and insufficient.</p>

<p>At the lower edge of the pectoralis minor, the artery is
crossed by the outer of the venæ comites, which passes between
the external cutaneous and the external origin of the
median nerve, at the spot where they separate from the
plexus. The artery may be tied below this separation, or
the nerves and vein may be drawn to the outside, and the
artery tied above the union of the external with the internal
root of the median nerve as high as the origin of the arteria
thoracica acromialis, the pectoralis minor being either raised
and pushed upward, or divided if necessary. The internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
root of the median nerve is in connection with the internal
cutaneous and ulnar nerves; the larger of the venæ comites
is to the inside and behind, but as it ascends it receives its
fellow, and with the cephalic vein forms in front of the
artery the subclavian vein.</p>

<p>237. The brachial artery can be traced by its pulsation
from the lower edge of the teres major muscle to below the
bend of the arm, where it is covered by the pronator radii
teres muscle. At first it is on the ulnar side of the humerus,
resting on the triceps, and slightly overlapped by the coraco-brachialis
and biceps muscles. In the middle of the arm it
rests on the tendon of the coraco-brachialis, is close to the
bone, and lies under the lower edge of the biceps; in which
situation it may always be compressed by bending the forearm,
so as to cause the belly of the biceps to enlarge, when
pressure made immediately below it will arrest the circulation
in the brachial artery. It then crosses toward the
anterior part of the arm, and rests on the brachialis anticus
muscle until it passes the bend of the elbow. It is accompanied
by two veins, which are connected with it by a loose
cellular membrane forming a sheath. The external cutaneous
and median nerves lie a little to the outside of the artery in
the upper third of the arm. In the middle third the median
nerve lies generally in front of, but sometimes between the
artery and the bone, and is on the inside at the inferior part.
The internal cutaneous nerve runs parallel with but superficial
to the artery, the ulnar nerve nearer but posterior to it.
When a ligature is to be placed on the brachial artery in the
upper part of its course, the incision should be made about
three inches in length, directly on the line of the pulsating
vessel, by which all mistakes will be avoided. The integuments
should be divided carefully, that the internal cutaneous
nerve may not be injured; the fascia is then to be cut through
and the forearm bent, when the vessels and nerves will be
relaxed. The artery is to be separated from its veins, one
on each side; and it must be recollected that the external cutaneous
and median nerves are to the radial side of the artery,
the internal cutaneous and the ulnar nerves to the ulnar side
of it. In the middle of the arm the median nerve lies immediately
over the artery, except in those cases where it
passes behind it; when it lies in front it may be mistaken
for the artery, from the pulsation being communicated to it.
The incision should be to the same extent of three inches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
directly in the course of the artery, and the ligature should
be passed from the ulnar to the radial side of the vessel, in
order to avoid the possibility of including either the internal
cutaneous or the ulnar nerve, and for the purpose of excluding
both the veins.</p>

<p>238. The brachial artery, a little below the bend of the
arm, divides into the radial and ulnar arteries&mdash;the radial
being the continuation of the brachial in direction, the ulnar
in size. The brachial artery, at the bend of the arm, is
cushioned on the brachialis internus muscle, having the tendon
of the biceps on the outside, the median nerve on its
inside, which is at first continued on the same side of the
artery, which now takes the name of ulnar. This vessel inclines
toward the ulna for about an inch, and then passes
between the two origins of the pronator radii teres muscle;
the median nerve crosses it at this part to get into the middle
of the arm, and is then separated from it by the ulnar
origin of the muscle. The artery continues its course, inclining
outwardly, under the pronator radii teres, the flexor
carpi radialis, the palmaris longus, and the flexor sublimis
muscles, lying on the flexor profundus. On clearing the
ulnar edge of the flexor sublimis, it is covered by the flexor
carpi ulnaris, the course of the artery having been obliquely
under these muscles to the extent of two inches. To
tie it in any part of this course, they must be more or less
divided, and the only difficulty or danger arises from the
median nerve, which lies deeper under the radial origin of
the pronator teres. But the whole of the muscular fibers
may be divided, without injuring the nerve, by successive
and careful incisions through them until the artery and nerve
are exposed, and a ligature may then be applied above and
below the wound in the vessel. It may be supposed, by way
of elucidation, that a man has received a wound from a sword
through the flexor muscles, which injures also the ulnar
artery, as may be presumed from its situation and the continued
and impetuous flow of blood. It may be further
supposed that this wound is in a slanting direction from the
ulna toward the radius. The surgeon, if he thinks he can
calculate the point at which the artery is injured, should cut
down upon it in the direction of the fibers of the intervening
muscles, and even through them until he reaches the artery;
but if he has erred in his calculation, he should introduce a
probe into the wound, and, after having ascertained the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
it has taken, he should cut, if necessary, across the muscular
fibers in that direction until he exposes the bleeding artery;
if he be careful not to divide the median nerve, no inconvenience
will arise from the operation. (<i>Aph.</i> 184, page 192.)</p>

<p>239. If the ulnar artery be wounded near its origin,
through the radial side of the pronator teres muscle, an
incision should be made through the integuments and the
aponeurosis of the biceps muscle; the pronator muscle being
then exposed, it is to be drawn inward and downward, or
toward the ulna, and the dissection continued until the
median nerve is brought into view. The probe introduced
through the original wound will lead to the artery, the pulsation
of which will be felt and the bleeding seen. Where
the nerve crosses the artery, the vessel will be found above
or to the radial side of it, and to the ulnar side below. It
may be tied above without dividing a muscular fiber; but at
the part where the nerve crosses, and below it, some fibers
of the pronator teres must be divided, and in some cases the
whole of them, before the artery can be properly secured by
two ligatures; but this division is of little or no consequence,
as the muscular fibers reunite without difficulty.</p>

<p>240. To tie the ulnar artery in the <i>middle third</i> of the
arm, the surgeon should bend the wrist, and trace upward
the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris as far as it can be felt.
At the point where it becomes indistinct, an incision should
be commenced and carried upward for the space of four
inches; the fascia is then to be divided to the same extent,
when the flexor carpi ulnaris may readily be traced upward
by its tendon, which is on the radial side of it; this muscle
may then be easily separated from the flexor sublimis, beneath
the edge of which the artery will be found covered by
the deep-seated fascia, having a vein on each side, and the
ulnar nerve to the ulnar side of it. By this method of proceeding
the artery will be readily exposed, which is not always
the case by any other manner of operating, and it may
be tied as high up as where it passes from under the flexors
of the arm.</p>

<p>The ulnar artery may be easily tied near the wrist, where
it is most superficial. Bend the wrist, and make the flexor
carpi ulnaris act, when the tendon will be felt internal to
the styloid process of the ulna; make an incision two inches
and a half in extent along the radial edge of this tendon,
dividing the fascia of the arm which covers it. The artery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
will be felt below the deep-seated fascia, and, on dividing it,
will be seen with its venæ comites, the ulnar nerve being
behind it; that nerve must be avoided, in the application of
a ligature.</p>

<p>241. The radial artery may be secured by ligature with
great ease in any part of its course to the wrist. At the
upper third of the arm, the radial artery is covered by the
approximation of the supinator radii longus and pronator
radii teres muscles. To expose it at this part, a line may
be drawn from the middle of the bend of the arm to the
thumb, which will indicate its course; or the supinator radii
longus being put into action, an incision is to be made from
the bend of the arm obliquely outward along its ulnar edge
to the extent of three inches, avoiding the median vein, but
dividing the integuments and the fascia. The supinator
muscle is then to be gently separated from the pronator
radii teres by the handle of the knife, and the artery will be
felt covered by the deep-seated fascia; on the division of
which, it will be seen with its venæ comites lying on some
adipose membrane, and on some branches of the musculo-spiral
nerve, which separate it from the tendon of the biceps,
and are to be carefully avoided. The musculo-spiral nerve
itself lies nearer the radius, rendering it advisable to pass
the aneurismal needle from that side.</p>

<p>In the middle third of the forearm, the inner edge of the
supinator radii longus marks the line of the incision, which
should be to the extent of three inches. The fascia being
divided, the supinator longus is to be separated from the
flexor carpi radialis, and, on the division of the deep fascia,
the artery will be found passing with its venæ comites over
the insertion of the pronator radii teres and the radial origin
of the flexor digitorum sublimis. The musculo-spiral
nerve lies close to the radial side of the artery.</p>

<p>Near the wrist, the radial artery may be tied with great
facility. Make an incision two inches and a half long on
the radial side of the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis,
which becomes prominent on bending the wrist; the superficial
and deep fasciæ are to be divided, when the artery and
its veins will be exposed; the nerve has not accompanied
the artery to this point, where it lies on the pronator quadratus,
whence it turns below the styloid process of the radius
to the back of the hand.</p>

<p>The radial artery, on giving off the superficialis volæ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the palm of the hand, near the end of the radius, inclines
outward, and, when between its styloid process and the trapezium,
lies beneath the two first extensors of the thumb.
Passing onward to reach the angle formed by the metacarpal
bones of the thumb and forefinger, it lies first in a triangular
space between these two extensor muscles and the third, in
which situation a ligature may readily be placed upon it by
a simple incision. Proceeding onward, the artery passes
<i>under</i> the third extensor and lies to the outside of it, where
it may also be secured by ligature without difficulty, just before
it dips into the palm and gives off the principal artery
to the thumb. After the radial artery has reached the inside
of the hand, to form the deep-seated palmar arch, it crosses
the metacarpal bones nearly at a right angle, covered by all
the muscles, tendons, and nerves of the palm. A branch of
the ulnar nerve is here seen going to the muscles of the
thumb. If the graduated compression recommended in
Aphorism 208, page 238, together with due pressure on the
radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist, should fail to arrest
the bleeding from a wound at this part, the two muscles,
forming what may be and is called the web, between the
thumb and forefinger should be divided until the wounded
artery can be seen. These muscles are the adductor pollicis
on the inside, and the adductor indicis on the back of the
hand; and their division would lead to little or no inconvenience.
If a man, in opening an oyster, were to divide these
muscles by an accidental thrust of his knife, it would not be
considered a serious accident, although some surgeons might
be dismayed if desired to divide them surgically, to expose
the artery at the spot where it has been wounded.</p>

<p class="h2sub">INJURIES OF THE BRAIN.</p>

<p>242. Injuries of the head affecting the brain are difficult
of distinction, doubtful in their character, treacherous in
their course, and for the most part fatal in their results.
The symptoms which appear especially to indicate one kind
of accident are frequently met with in another. It may even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
be said that there is no one symptom which is presumed to
demonstrate a particular lesion of the brain, which has not
been shown to have taken place in another of a different
kind. Examination after death has often proved the presence
of a most serious injury the existence of which had not
even been suspected; and death has often ensued immediately,
or shortly after the most marked and alarming symptoms,
without any adequate cause for the event being discovered
on dissection. One man shall lose a considerable portion of
his brain without its being productive at the moment of the
slightest apparent functional inconvenience; while another
shall fall, and shortly die without an effort at recovery, in
spite of any treatment which may be bestowed upon him,
after a very much slighter injury inflicted apparently on the
same part. During the war with the United States, in 1814,
a soldier in Canada was struck by a ball which lodged in the
posterior part of the side of the head; the wound healed,
and the man returned to his duty. Twelve months afterward,
having got drunk, he fell in the streets of Montreal,
and died. The ball was found lying on the corpus callosum,
where it had made a small hole or sac for itself. After the
battle of Waterloo, I recommended, in the case of a soldier
similarly wounded, that nothing should be done unless symptoms
arose demanding the use of the trephine; as none occurred,
and the wound healed, the man was sent home to
Colchester, where he got drunk, and fell dead in the marketplace.
The ball was lodged deeply in a cyst in the posterior
lobe of the brain. Persons rarely live with a foreign body
lodged in the anterior lobe of the brain, although many recover
with the loss of a portion of the brain at that part.
An injury of apparently equal extent is more dangerous on
the forehead than on the side or middle of the head, and
much less so on the back part than on the side. A fracture
of the vertex is of infinitely less importance than one at the
base of the cranium, which, although not necessarily fatal, is
always attended with the utmost danger. The treatment of
these several injuries (although they may be at first sight
apparently similar) cannot, and must not be alike in all&mdash;a
fact which should always be borne in mind in their management.
In civil life, both in hospitals and among private
persons, injuries of the base of the cranium are most frequently
met with, because they are generally the consequence
of falls; while in military life injuries of the base of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the skull are rare, and those of other parts are common.
The practice of the military surgeon, with respect to injuries
of the cranium and its contents, is therefore more successful,
all things considered, than that of the surgeon in civil life,
and particularly in a great metropolis; this may perhaps
account for some of the discrepancies in opinion which have
existed between them.</p>

<p>243. Many physiologists have thought they could indicate
the part of the brain injured from the symptoms which followed,
and there are some which do not admit of dispute as
to their cause; but there are very many which at present do
not admit of being distinctly traced to their source. Birds,
small quadrupeds, fishes, and reptiles will live for some
weeks after nearly all the contents of the skull have been
removed. Sensation, volition, memory, judgment, sight,
hearing, and all other sensations are lost by the removal of
the cerebral hemispheres. The mobility of the iris is destroyed,
not by the removal of the hemispheres, but of the
corpora quadrigemina. If the cerebellum be cut away, a
bird can no longer jump, walk, or retain its natural position,
but it can move and live. When the medulla oblongata, or
medulla spinalis, or the nerves of these parts, have been
divided, muscular contraction ceases, and all power of movement
is lost. Life is destroyed because respiration ceases
when the medulla oblongata is divided at or immediately below
the origin of the eighth pair of nerves. The removal of any
one of these nervous parts in the lower animals only weakens
the powers of those which remain. In man it destroys them,
and life is extinguished.</p>

<p>244. Respiration consists of four movements&mdash;1, the opening
of the mouth and dilatation of the nostrils; 2, the opening
of the glottis; 3, the elevation of the ribs; 4, the contraction
of the diaphragm. The division of the dorsal
spinal marrow, below the origin of the phrenic nerve, paralyzes
the movement of the ribs; above the phrenic nerves it
paralyzes the diaphragm, and respiration ceases; the yawning
or opening of the mouth and glottis alone remain. On
dividing the point of origin of the par vagum, the movements
of the glottis cease. On slicing the upper part of
the medulla oblongata instead of the lower, from before
backward, the opening or yawning of the mouth ceases;
another slice, and the dilatations of the nose are arrested,
and the inspiratory movements of the trunk alone remain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>While the power of motion in each part seems thus to be
dependent on isolated points of the medulla oblongata and
the medulla spinalis, an indirect or connecting influence is
admitted to take place between them and the remaining
parts of the brain; and whatever may be its nature or extent
in animals, there can be no doubt of its being so infinitely
greater in man as to be essentially different; for none of
these experiments can be made either artificially or accidentally
on any one of these parts in him, without being productive
of the ultimate if not almost immediate death of
the whole.</p>

<p>Dr. Marshall Hall, in the comprehensive and luminous
view he has taken of the nervous system, supposes that each
sentient and motor nerve of the spinal marrow is further
endowed with an excito-motor power for reflex action. He
calls these generally excito-motor nerves, and considers
them to be connected with a part of the medulla spinalis,
distinct from that portion which is strictly an appendage to
the brain. <i>Incident</i> nerves arise from the skin and certain
mucous membranes, and convey impressions from them to
the spinal marrow. <i>Reflex</i> nerves convey back the nervous
influence excited through the medium of the incident nerves,
to the voluntary muscles in which they terminate; and Dr.
Marshall Hall further considers that these nerves, and the
part he calls the true spinal cord, constitute the true spinal
system which presides over ingestion and exclusion, retention
and egestion; and consequently that its influence is exerted
upon the muscles which belong to the entrances and outlets
of the animal frame; or, in other words, upon the sphincters,
and the muscles of deglutition and of respiration; and that
the true spinal system maintains the tone of the whole muscular
system. Stimulating an incident or excitor nerve of
the extremities, by tickling or pricking the sole of the foot or
the palm of the hand after sensation is apparently destroyed,
causes a special muscular contraction or motion in the limb,
if the excito-motor system be uninjured. Irritating the eyelashes
induces contraction of the eyelids; and the irritation of
one will sometimes cause contraction of both. Tickling the
verge of the anus induces contraction of the sphincter muscle.
Irritating the fauces and the root of the tongue, by pressing
it down with the handle of a spoon, induces an action of
deglutition. Respiration is excited by irritating or exciting
the trifacial or fifth pair of nerves, by throwing cold water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
on the face, and stimulating the nostrils; by influencing the
spinal nerves by a similar use of cold water to the body and
chest, and by tickling or stimulating the sides, soles of the
feet, and verge of the anus.</p>

<p>The great object or value of these and other facts and
physiological experiments is to enable us to conclude, as far
as possible, what part, what great division of the brain or
spinal marrow is most seriously injured, more particularly
with respect to the prognosis than to the treatment. Great
severity and persistence of the symptoms lead to the belief
that the part of the brain or spinal marrow on which they
depend is directly injured rather than indirectly affected,
and that the result is more likely to be fatal. Permanent
insensibility and loss of motion may depend on cerebral mischief
only. The loss of the mobility of the iris implies an
affection of the tubercula quadrigemina. Convulsions,
vomiting, a drawing up of the limb not affected by paralysis,
stertor, a difficulty in swallowing, strabismus, and relaxed
sphincters, show derangement of the spinal functions; which
is well marked when tickling the eyelashes does not cause
closing of the lid, of the verge of the anus no contraction of
the sphincter, of the sole of the foot no motion of the toes.</p>

<p>245. In order to simplify the investigation of Injuries of
the Head, they have been divided into two great classes: one
denominated Injuries from Concussion; the other, Injuries
from Compression or Irritation of the Brain. By the term
Concussion of the Brain, a certain indefinable something, or
cause of evil which cannot be demonstrated, is understood
to have taken place; the effect of which is often clearly
proved by the almost instantaneous death of the individual,
or by a succession of symptoms which quickly lead to his
destruction. The term concussion is very aptly and forcibly
illustrated by the homely but striking expression in use in
the sister country, when a man has been suddenly killed by
a fall on the head, “that the life has been shook out of him.”
On a dissection of the brain in a pure case of this kind, no
trace of injury or even of derangement of any part of it
can be perceived. Life is extinct, but the brain is intact.
The immaterial has been separated from the material part,
by an injury apparently inflicted on the very seat of life,
with as little apparent derangement of its structure as if
death had occurred in a secondary manner from the abstraction
of blood by a rupture of the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Modern surgery has in fact added nothing to our information
on the subject, perhaps from the peculiar difficulties
of the case, which may not admit of removal in the present
state of our knowledge; although all writers seem to coincide
in opinion that a sudden stoppage of the circulation of
the blood is the more immediate cause of death. That the
positive shock communicated to the brain from one side to
the other, and the repercussion which follows from its
resiliency, are capable of giving rise to a direct and visible
injury, is indisputable. It usually forms on what may be
termed the edges of the hemispheres, which appear to be
discolored, bruised, and sometimes torn, so as to have caused
the term laceration to be given to this kind of injury. This
mischief, however, is most commonly found in the examination
of those persons who have survived the accident for
some days, and is therefore only a predisposing cause of
death.</p>

<p>246. When an injury is not immediately fatal, and life,
although for a time in imminent danger, is not destroyed,
yet fluctuates on the verge of destruction, gradually to be
restored, again to fail, and at the end of several days to be
eventually extinguished, the changes which take place in the
functions of the brain during this period are accompanied by
alterations which are observable in its appearance. The
assemblage of phenomena which have taken place constitute
inflammation; and it is only by that vigorous treatment
which subdues inflammatory action that a person in whom
they have occurred can be preserved. The immaterial part
of man is so intimately connected with his material part
that they cannot be suddenly separated without the material
part receiving an irrecoverable though often an imperceptible
detriment; the bonds which unite them cannot be
temporarily loosened without a derangement taking place,
which appears to require for its recovery the aid of some of
those processes of nature which are known to occur in the
restoration to health of other parts of the body. A moderate
shock is often immediately followed by sickness, faintness,
weakness, and in a few hours by a slight headache, from
which the person quickly recovers without further inconvenience;
or the headache may remain for several days the
sole symptom or sign of an injury having been sustained;
the slightest possible approach to that action which we call
inflammation having sufficed to effect a cure. One step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
further, the headache continues, the stomach sympathizes,
there is little or no desire for food, the whole person feels
more or less deranged, and the pulse quickens. A smart
purgative will perhaps relieve all these manifestations of
approaching evil, but the loss of a little blood will be more
certainly efficacious.</p>

<p>A child ten years of age fell over the banisters into the
passage, and struck its forehead. It was taken up apparently
lifeless, but it soon appeared that it was only stunned;
it breathed deeply, looked about vacantly, and could not
speak; it then vomited, and gradually recovered its speech
and senses. A brisk purgative was all that was required to
remove the slight headache which followed on the subsequent
day.</p>

<p>In more dangerous cases which ultimately prove fatal,
the laceration of the brain alluded to complicates the mischief
as well as the symptoms, and is perhaps the actual
cause of death. It has, however, been demonstrated that a
slighter injury of the kind, giving rise to long-continued
symptoms, need not necessarily be fatal; in which case it is
supposed that the cure is effected by adhesion, and not
by granulation accompanied by the secretion of purulent
matter.</p>

<p>247. When a concussion of the brain has rendered the
sufferer insensible and motionless, the countenance is deadly
pale, (the reverse of what takes place in sanguineous apoplexy;)
the pulse is not discoverable: the man does not
appear to breathe. It is useless to open his veins, for they
cannot bleed until he begins to recover; and then the loss
of blood would probably kill him. It is as improper to put
strong drinks into his mouth, for he cannot swallow; and if
he should be so far recovered as to make the attempt, they
might possibly enter the larynx and destroy him. If he
should appear to breathe, and be made to inhale very strong
stimulating salts, it will probably give rise to inflammation
of the inside of his nose and throat, to his subsequent great
distress. Mild stimulants and disagreeably smelling substances
held to the nose, together with partial as well as
general friction with the warm hands, are the best means to
be adopted, and should be continued until it be ascertained
that life is extinct. If the patient should recover, some
signs of breathing will be discoverable, followed by a distinct
inspiration, repeated at so distant an interval as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
render its recurrence uncertain. At last respiration is satisfactorily
established, and the pulse, which was doubtful at
the commencement of the restoration to existence, becomes
perceptible, although often irregular, and sometimes continues
so until reaction has taken place. With this partial
recovery of the natural functions of the body, vomiting is apt
to supervene, and is one of the earliest and most satisfactory
symptoms of returning sensibility. It was formerly supposed
to be peculiar to cases of concussion, but it is often present
in cases evidently of compression or irritation from external
violence. The breathing becomes in general quite free; and
although it is occasionally labored, it is rarely stertorous, a
symptom which may be considered, when permanent, as a
more distinct sign of continued irritation, or of compression
and of extravasation, than of concussion. The sensibility
of the surface, however, is not fully re-established, the patient
is not cognizant of any injury committed upon him, and if
he should recover, has no recollection of what has passed.
This first stage does not last long, and with the partial
re-establishment of the functions of the lungs and of the
heart, and of the circulation of the blood through the brain,
although irregularly or insufficiently performed, the second
stage may be supposed to begin. The patient is still in a
state of stupefaction, although now perhaps sensible to personal
maltreatment; and in this condition he may remain
for many days; he draws away or moves the part aggrieved;
he may be able to answer in a monosyllable correctly or
otherwise to questions loudly put, as if to rouse him from
slumber; but if the answer should be longer, it will generally
be incoherent. The pupils are for the most part in a medium
or in a contracted state, but rarely dilated. Stimulants
were formerly given at and up to this point, with a view of
reviving and restoring the patient to greater activity, and to
prevent a relapse into his former state. Dissection has,
however, proved that it is a state in which congestion is
about to be followed by inflammation of the brain or of its
membranes; that the stage succeeding to this is one of active
inflammation, even if the patient should eventually recover;
and if he relapse into that state of stupefactive insensibility
which precedes death, sufficient evidence to account for his
decease may be found in the laceration of the substance of
the brain, in small extravasations in various parts, or in
other mischief which may not perhaps be expected. Pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>viously
to this stage of fatal termination, the muscles are
not relaxed, and do not lose their tone, as in a similarly
fatal case of compression of the brain; the urine does not
flow involuntarily until after the spinal marrow has been
some time seriously implicated, and death is at hand. This
renders it necessary, in all cases of injury of the head, to
attend to the state of the bladder, which may become distended,
and render the use of the catheter necessary. The
urine will be acid as long as the catheter is required, and
will become alkaline as soon as it dribbles away involuntarily.
The bowels will at an early period be confined, and more
powerful doses of aperient medicines will be required than
are needed under more ordinary circumstances, although the
sphincter ani may be relaxed, and the power of retention be
lost from the first, provided the injury has been very severe.
When the feces pass involuntarily, it is presumed that the
cerebro-spinal axis is seriously affected, and that the excito-motory
system is greatly impaired, if not wholly destroyed.
When a person is insensible, it is not always easy or convenient
to ascertain whether the feces pass involuntarily
from loss of power of the sphincter ani, or are discharged
from the ordinary action of the bowels, of which the patient
cannot give notice. It may be inferred when the urine
flows in a stream, although apparently in an involuntary
manner, that the power of the detrusor muscle of the bladder
is only impaired. In general, certain efforts are made to
evacuate the bowels, although the person may be upon the
whole unconscious of the act, showing that the defect is not
essentially in the sphincter ani, but in the want of consciousness
in the brain.</p>

<p>Vomiting should not be solicited, as it may do harm when
in excess, but when slight, it has appeared to be beneficial.
The more simple the treatment during this the period of
commencing reaction, the more likely is it to be ultimately
successful. The period at which insensibility ceases, and the
re-establishment of the natural functions of respiration and
of the circulation begins, must always be uncertain.</p>

<p>248. The termination of the first and the commencement
of the second or really inflammatory stage, or that tending
to recovery, is marked on dissection by the vessels of the
brain and of its membranes being full of blood, and showing
those appearances which are indicative of inflammation. If
the patient is to recover, the stupefaction, or <i>assoupissement</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
continues, although a greater degree of sensibility prevails;
the pulse becomes regular, if it were not so before; the skin
is hotter than natural; the patient can often be induced to
show his tongue, which is white, and to answer shortly, and
tell where he feels pain, although he often answers incorrectly;
he can sometimes put out his hand and help himself,
and occasionally even get out of bed. He usually turns to
avoid the light, and the pupils are for the most part contracted;
but no reliance can be placed on the state of the
pupils at this period of the complaint; both are sometimes
dilated, or one is dilated and the other contracted&mdash;sometimes
dilating on the admission of light, sometimes contracting;
or they may not be in the least changed until shortly
before death. An alteration from the ordinary state of the
pupils does not prove the absence or presence of any serious
general injury, but only that a particular part of the brain
has been more or less affected. The breathing at this period
is free, and not in the least noisy or stertorous, unless the
concussion be complicated with irritation occurring from
lesion of the brain or its membranes, or of the medulla oblongata.
The patient may remain in this state without any
sensible alteration for several days, or he may, as is more
commonly the case when restoration to health is to follow,
recover his speech as well as his general sensibility; nevertheless
he frequently speaks more or less incoherently, mutters
to himself as if thinking of something, and wanders at
night, becoming even delirious, and requiring restraint to
keep him in bed. Inflammation of the brain is now fully
established and must be subdued. It is at or about this
period that other symptoms occur, which are frequently
enumerated as those indicative of concussion&mdash;it should be
added, of concussion in its latter stage. The pulse becomes
quicker, perhaps full or hard, varying from 84 to 90, and even
to 100. In such cases, an augmented pulsation of the carotids
may often be observed, and is considered by some to be
confirmative of the fact of concussion, although it is by no
means a sign to be entirely depended upon. Such a person
will not be comatose, but watchful, sleeps little or none,
talks incoherently, or is often really delirious, refuses food if
offered, drinks with avidity, has a hot skin, and a white
tongue. If other symptoms occur, such as spasms or convulsions,
the absolute loss of any sense, or paralysis of any
or the whole of a part, the case is complicated by laceration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of the brain, compression, or other causes of mischief, from
the effects of which, if he cannot be relieved by blood-letting,
he gradually sinks into a state of coma, and dies.</p>

<p>The deviations which take place from the usual and ordinary
modes of breathing are supposed to offer distinctive
signs of the nature of the injury which has taken place, but
they are uncertain; they mark the degree of injury, and perhaps
the part injured, rather than anything else. Stertorous
breathing has always been considered a sign of extravasation
causing compression of the brain. Many cases, however,
have occurred of slight extravasation with partial loss of
power of one-half the body, accompanied by great numbness,
without any stertor in breathing; but a well-marked
case of large extravasation has rarely or never been observed
without it, or another peculiarity of breathing which is less
thought of, although an equally characteristic and dangerous
sign of such mischief having taken place when it is permanent;
this is a peculiar whiff or puff from the corner of
the mouth, as if the patient were smoking. This, when
observed among other urgent symptoms, is usually followed
by death. Stertorous breathing and the whiff or puff at the
corner of the mouth are presumed to indicate an injury to
the cerebro-spinal axis as well as to the cerebrum; but
whether the injury be direct or indirect is uncertain, although
it is frequently accompanied by extravasation or laceration.
When the breathing is only oppressed or labored or heavy,
neither extravasation nor lesion to any extent can in general
be discovered after death. The surgeon will then practically
be right in considering the stertor or whiff in breathing to
be accompanied by, if not directly dependent on, extravasation
or lesion; and the heavy or labored breathing to be
dependent generally on a derangement of function, which
is not perceptible on examination. If there be truth in
experimental anatomy, stertorous breathing ought to be dependent
on a direct affection of the medulla oblongata;
nevertheless there can be no doubt that a temporary stertor
or a puff at the corner of the mouth may exist without it, as
a consequence of too great an abstraction of blood.</p>

<p>An officer, exercising his regiment under a hot sun in
Portugal, suddenly fell back on his horse, and was carried
home insensible and breathing stertorously; from this state
he soon recovered, feeling weak in his lower limbs and incapable
of influencing the sphincter ani, which was soon fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>lowed
by incontinence of urine. His intellectual faculties
were never affected after the first insensibility; and on the
third day he rode on a mule, with care, twenty miles to
Lisbon. Many months elapsed before he recovered the
necessary command over the sphincter ani. Years have
elapsed, and he cannot now always retain his urine. In this
case the spinal marrow would seem to have been principally
affected.</p>

<p>It is important to recollect that the stupefaction or insensibility
of concussion is coeval with the injury, and that as
few cases of compression of the brain occur without some
degree of concussion, the insensibility may in many instances
depend on it. The stupefaction peculiar to compression,
demanding relief by blood-letting or by operation, is that
which comes on some two or more hours after the accident,
and is caused by congestion or by extravasation; it must
also be distinguished from that which appears after several
days, and is the consequence of inflammatory action and
effusion. The pulse has been supposed to offer a diagnostic
sign of the nature of the mischief which has taken place in
the brain; pressure or extravasation, it is said, being attended
by a slow and labored action of the heart. This
may be admitted as a general, but by no means as a certain
rule, for many of the largest extravasations, and many of the
most diffused, have been accompanied throughout by a very
quick pulse. When the physiological doctrines of the circulation
are duly considered, as well as the experiments on
which they are founded, it will be evident that the action of
the heart may be influenced by other causes than those
occurring from the part of the brain apparently injured.
Pressure made purposely on the brain or dura mater in man
during life is always followed, when carried to too great an
extent, by a diminution in the frequency of the pulse, and
even by syncope.</p>

<p>When the stage of depression is slowly passing into that
of excitement, and inflammation is about to be set up,
bleeding may be had recourse to; but what quantity of
blood, if any, should be taken away, is often doubtful. The
loss of six, eight, or even of ten ounces can do no harm, if
it do no good, and it may enable the surgeon to form a
more accurate judgment of the state or degree of the complaint
than he could otherwise have done.</p>

<p>A laboring man, thirty years of age, fell from a height<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
of fifteen feet, on the back of his head, a small puffy tumor
being perceivable near the junction of the right parietal
with the occipital bone. He was insensible and motionless;
countenance deadly pale; circulation weak in the arms, but
more marked in the carotids; respiration heavy and slow;
pupils much dilated and fixed; no relaxation of the sphincters.
Hot-water bottles were applied to the feet, and
friction to the body generally. In the afternoon he became
warmer; some reaction seemed to be taking place, accompanied
by slight twitchings of the face, and shiverings. At
four o’clock he was bled to sixteen ounces, in consequence of
the pulse having become fuller, although soft and 96 in the
minute. The surface was warm and moist, and he was so
far sensible as to complain, on being pressed for an answer,
of pain at the part of the head injured. The bleeding was
discontinued, in consequence of its bringing on <i>convulsive</i>
movements ending in syncope; the pupils contracted, the
countenance became deadly white, and he breathed on the
right side of his mouth for a few minutes, with the whiff
or puff so peculiar in cases of compression of the brain. On
recovering from his swoon, the pulse became regular and 85
in number, the skin warm and moist, and the pupils more
sensible to their proper stimulus. The bladder, which had
been a little distended, acted voluntarily. The next day he
was perfectly collected, and complained only of a little pain
in the head. Pulse 84; was quiet and slept during a part
of the night. The bowels acted under the influence of the
calomel and colocynth given the evening before, and of a
senna draught in the morning. He quickly recovered,
without any further bad symptoms.</p>

<p>The effects of a large abstraction of blood at too early a
period are well shown in this case, especially by the convulsions
and by the peculiar kind of breathing.</p>

<p>249. When the period of excitement or of inflammation
has begun, and the patient, although disposed to coma, is
still irrational and impatient when roused, he is not to be
left to await the effects of a blistering plaster or of a dose of
physic, as has been recommended in such cases, but ought to
be bled sitting up in bed to whatever extent may be necessary
to relieve the symptoms, or at least to cause a near approach
to fainting, for nothing less can relieve such a person
effectually, and give him a fair chance for life. The bleeding
must be steadily repeated as the symptoms recur until relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
has been obtained, or until it becomes evident that the powers
of the patient cannot resist the inroads of the disease and of
the efforts made for its cure. The quantity of blood that
may be lost in two or three days by powerful, healthy men is
sometimes enormous, amounting to 100, 150, and even 200
ounces, with the happiest effect. The following case, which
was one of inflammation tending to effusion, will show the
extent to which it ought to be carried in an elderly person
of a different habit of body:&mdash;</p>

<p>A gentleman, sixty-seven years of age, had suffered for
three weeks from occasional attacks of gout in his right foot,
which he had himself treated by simple means, taking the
pulvis ipecacuanhæ compositus at night to relieve pain.
Once or twice his family had observed that his head was, for
a short time, not so clear as usual; but no suspicion of further
evil was entertained until he awoke one morning,
evidently talking incoherently. As the gout had nearly disappeared
from his feet, sinapisms were applied to both; purgatives
and diaphoretics were freely administered, and he
appeared to be relieved. On the third morning he became
more loquacious and forgetful, was occasionally incoherent,
and complained of a certain loss of power, and of numbness
in the right side. Pulse 84, full and regular; tongue white;
some confusion of ideas was evident, with slight headache.
He was cupped at ten in the morning to ten ounces, without
advantage; as all the symptoms appeared to be increasing,
at four in the afternoon sixteen ounces of blood were
taken from the arm, which produced a marked effect for
some time. At ten at night, the symptoms having returned,
and the blood drawn being very much cupped and buffed,
twelve ounces more were taken from the arm, when the pulse
quickened and began to intermit; he appeared to be about
to faint, and the object seemed to be attained. Calomel and
opium were then given every four hours, until the mouth
became affected; but the essential symptoms were already
subdued, and the patient recovered, with a slight sensation
of numbness and loss of power of the right side of the body
and head.</p>

<p>The necessary effect was in this case produced by the loss
of forty ounces of blood. In a younger and more vigorous
man it might have required three or four times as much to
have been taken away by repeated bleedings, before the ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>ject
could have been attained; of this the following case is
a good instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. B., having jumped out of a carriage, the horses
of which were running away at full gallop, fell on his face,
and was found insensible and motionless. Some cold water
having been poured upon him, he gradually recovered, and
afterward ate a hearty dinner, drank a bottle of port wine,
and walked home, a distance of three miles. He thought
himself quite well the next morning, and went to bathe; but
on returning about noon he felt uneasy, lay down on a sofa,
began to talk incoherently, and was soon quite delirious. At
one o’clock he was bled, but the symptoms of inflammation
were not completely subdued until he had lost eighty-four
ounces of blood, the last quantity being taken away at eleven
at night. The vigorous treatment adopted in this case
during the first ten hours in all probability saved the life of
the patient.</p>

<p>250. It sometimes happens that congestion precedes inflammation
to such an extent as to give rise to stupefaction
and symptoms of compression.</p>

<p>A Portuguese soldier of General Harvey’s brigade of the
fourth division of infantry was struck by a musket-ball at the
first siege of Badajos, on the top and toward the back part
of the head; it divided the soft parts, and grazed the bone
without fracturing it. He walked from the trenches to the
rear, and said he was not much hurt. About five or six
hours afterward, he was found apparently asleep, and could
not be awakened, on which I was asked to see him. Finding
the pulse at 60, regular and full, although compressible,
I directed him to be raised and blooded until he fainted.
When he had lost some twenty ounces of blood, he opened
his eyes, recovered his senses, and knew those about him.
The next day he went to the rear, free from all symptoms,
and rejoined some time afterward, in apparent good health,
although he complained more than was usual to him of the
heat of the sun.</p>

<p>In some less important cases of injury, one bleeding will
answer the purpose; cupping and leeches may also be resorted
to with advantage; but in all very severe ones general blood-letting
is the only trustworthy source of relief. It should
always be done with effect, the finger examining the opposite
pulse, and regulating the amount to be taken away. At an
early period of concussion, the quantity drawn should not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
large; it should increase with the urgency for its abstraction,
and diminish with the frequency of the repetition, being
always, however, carefully regulated by the effect. The inability
of blood-letting to overcome the disease will be shown
by the increase in frequency of the pulse, its diminution in
power under slight compression, its greater softness, together
with the persistence of the other symptoms.</p>

<p>It is in these cases that repeated small bleedings, to the
amount of six or eight ounces, ought to be resorted to,
when it is doubtful whether the loss of blood can or cannot
be borne; they may then be considered not as curative, but
as explorative measures, although they sometimes prove very
effective; and when not properly regulated, the reverse.</p>

<p>In all these, and in other more desperate cases, the effect
of mercury, provided it has been early and rapidly administered,
may yet be decisive. Calomel, combined with another
and not less important remedy, opium, ought to be given
every two or three hours until the effects of both are fairly
induced.</p>

<p>Blisters should never be applied to the head until after
the leading symptoms of inflammation have been overcome;
they will do more good at a later period, applied between
the shoulders or on the nape of the neck. They should be
dressed with mercurial and savine, or other stimulating ointment.</p>

<p>The hair should be cut close in ordinary cases, or shaved
off in the more serious ones. The head should be raised in
bed, and kept wet with a cold evaporating lotion, or one
composed of two ounces of the nitrate of potash, one of the
muriate of ammonia, one pint of vinegar, and five of water,
made in small quantities at a time, as may be required; or
with a small quantity of pounded ice and water in a large
bladder. Perfect quietude, cold drinks, at pleasure, and
nearly absolute starvation should be enforced.</p>

<p>The different points of practice which have been noticed
are well illustrated by the following case, in which the symptoms
of concussion were complicated by those which are commonly
observed in compression of the brain:&mdash;</p>

<p>An old man, when cleaning windows, fell from some steps
on his forehead, which he slightly cut and bruised, the left
temporal artery being divided by another small cut: it bled
profusely until the hemorrhage was arrested by a surgeon.
He remained in a state of insensibility for nearly two hours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
when he rallied, and answered questions, although imperfectly.
Pulse quicker than natural, and intermittent. He
shortly afterward relapsed into a state of insensibility, with
convulsions, stertorous breathing, puffing at the corner of the
mouth, and complete loss of voluntary motion: the pulse
could scarcely be felt. This convulsive fit lasted about ten
minutes, when his respiration became natural, and his pulse
was restored. The insensibility continued for an hour, when
it was attempted to bleed him, but the pulse fell immediately,
and it was not persisted in. He soon, however, became quite
sensible, sat up in bed, and vomited some blood. In the
afternoon he had another and slighter fit, from which he
quickly recovered. On the third day he was free from all
bad symptoms, and said, when asked, that he had only a very
slight headache. The pulse occasionally intermitted. On
the fourth he declared he was starved, became snappish and
irritable, complained of pain in the head, and had a quick
and irregular pulse. On the fifth he got up and dressed himself,
had another slight convulsive fit, and fell into a state of
stupefaction, for which bleeding gave little relief; and in the
evening he died. From the first period of his improving
until his death, sensation and motion remained. On examination,
a starred fracture without depression was found corresponding
to the wound on the forehead, continuing to the
base of the frontal bone, across the ethmoid, over the body
of the sphenoid bone, breaking off the posterior clinoid processes,
and extending to the basilar process of the occipital
bone, but not quite to the foramen magnum. The anterior
lobe of the right hemisphere of the cerebrum was lacerated
to the extent of an inch; that part was surrounded by the
usual appearances of inflammation. Some blood was extravasated
on the tentorium, beneath the posterior lobe of the
brain, and lymph was effused over the whole of its surface,
between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. The
trephine, if resorted to, would have only added to the mischief.</p>

<p>Inebriation from spirituous liquors may complicate a case
at its earliest period, from the stupefaction it occasions;
but the odor of the spirits is usually demonstrative of the
fact, and the stomach-pump in such cases is an admirable
remedy.</p>

<p>251. Mania sometimes supervenes on concussion, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
inflammatory symptoms subside. It is best treated by the
different preparations of opium.</p>

<p>George Grey, aged forty-five, a stout man, fell from an
omnibus, Nov. 1, 1839, and received a blow on the right
parietal bone, a little behind the coronal suture. He lies on
his back in a state of stupefaction, although sensible when
pinched, but is restless, and suffers from convulsive motions
of the mouth and limbs; pupils fixed, the right being more
dilated than the left; pulse 120; heat of skin natural; respiration
deep and rapid, without stertor; the sphincters not
relaxed. A turpentine enema was given, and a calomel pill
was swallowed with great difficulty. The head was shaved,
and a cold lotion applied; he soon afterward became violent,
and required the restraint of a tight jacket. The pulse
fell in the afternoon to 84.</p>

<p>Nov. 2d.&mdash;Passed a restless night without sleep, and has a
wild appearance: pulse 96, and regular. At twelve o’clock
became sensible, and gave a confused account of the accident.
Was freely purged, and a quarter of a grain of the
acetate of morphia was given every four hours: the first at
seven, the second at eleven, and the third at three in the
morning.</p>

<p>3d.&mdash;Has passed a quiet night, but with little sleep; the
morphia has had a soothing effect; talks rationally, although
a little confusedly, and recognized his mother, who says he
received a violent blow on the head three years ago, which
has rendered him mad ever since whenever he drinks too
much. Pulse 72; bowels open, and is free from restraint.
At seven in the evening, he suddenly started up in bed, saying
some one was going to murder him. Half a grain of
the acetate of morphia quieted him; it was repeated at
half-past twelve and at half-past four, and kept him quiet,
although he did not sleep.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;He was collected, quiet, and free from restraint;
pulse 96, rather full; secretions natural. The morphia was
continued in adequate doses for a few days, and he gradually
recovered.</p>

<p>252. Concussion induces affections of the brain and of its
membranes of an equally serious nature, at a more distant
period of time, when the stage of stupefaction and insensibility
is wanting; it is to guard against such an occurrence
that persons who suffer from falls or severe blows on the
head usually lose blood. A gentleman was thrown from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
gig near Hounslow, and received a very severe shock and
several bruises, without feeling much hurt, or being aware
that his head had actually touched the ground. He came
up to town, went to bed, and got up next morning suffering
only from a slight headache, and stiff from his bruises, of
which, however, he thought nothing. On the second day I
saw him in consequence of headache, throbbing in the temples,
sickness, and general malaise or discomfort. Being a
stout young man, thirty ounces of blood were taken from the
arm in a sitting posture, until he nearly fainted, after which
he was relieved. In the evening, the symptoms having all
returned, pulse 88, and full, he was bled in the erect position
until he fainted, forty ounces being taken away. The blood
of the morning was buffed and cupped, and the bowels had
acted freely. On the morning of the third day the pulse,
which had become fuller, yielded to the loss of twenty-four
ounces of blood, and in the afternoon, on its rising again, to
sixteen more; after which the symptoms gradually subsided,
and he appeared to be restored to health, with one interruption
from irregularity in diet, requiring the further loss of
blood by cupping behind the ears, and some sharp purgation.
His cure was not, however, permanent; for having dined
out a month afterward, he became delirious during the night,
and required to lose sixteen ounces of blood in the morning,
which relieved, but did not cure him. Some pain remained
in his head, the pulse continued at 90, the tongue was white,
with thirst, loss of appetite, and watchfulness. Calomel and
opium were now administered until the mouth became
affected, when he quickly got well; although a slight relapse
or two afterward convinced him that he could not drink nor
lead an irregular life with impunity.</p>

<p>There are no cases of convalescence after disease or injury
which require more care than those which follow injuries of
the head. Relapses, from apparently trifling causes, are extremely
frequent, and gradually but certainly undermine the
health; they are, in fact, connected with chronic derangement
of the brain, or of its membranes; and unless successfully
met, generally end, after the lapse of a few weeks or
months, in irritative fever and death. In many instances,
particularly among poor people subject to privations and of
irregular habits, in whom an injury of the head has not originally
been of any apparent importance, such a state of irritation,
if it occur, combined with debility, is very difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
manage; it requires a combination of local as well as of general
means for its cure. A few leeches and blisters may be
applied alternately over the part affected, with great advantage;
and a mild, nourishing diet, with gentle alteratives
and tonics, will expedite the cure, especially when aided by
perfect repose and a fresher atmosphere. An issue in the
arm, which establishes a gentle but permanent drain, will
often be found an efficacious remedy.</p>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE HEAD.</p>

<p>253. Compression of the brain means a diminution of the
size of certain parts of it, resulting from the pressure of an
extraneous body, whether it be fluid or solid, in consequence
of which particular symptoms are generally known to ensue.
When they occur, it is said that the sufferer is laboring under
symptoms of compression of the brain, and apoplexy from
the rupture of a blood-vessel may be considered as the best
form or illustration of the complaint. These symptoms
sometimes take place from the presence of a foreign substance,
such as a point or piece of bone, which from the
smallness of its size can hardly compress, although it may
displace; and it is then said that the symptoms arise from
irritation of the brain. Many of them have also been found
to occur from loss of blood, or the absence of pressure, or
from insufficient pressure arising from changes in the circulation;
and several different opinions have been entertained
on all the points connected with these subjects. It has been
argued that as the brain is incompressible, no compression
can take place. There is no proof, however, of the fact of
its being incompressible as a whole, although it has been
stoutly maintained by Monro secundus, Sir C. Bell, and
others.</p>

<p>The brain is surrounded by membranes capable of secreting
a halitus or a fluid whenever it may be necessary to fill
up space; it is intersected by partitions apparently for the
prevention of jar and pressure, and is permeated in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
part by vessels of various sizes, both venous and arterial.
It has been presumed that it contains at all times the same
quantity, or nearly the same quantity, of blood, in consequence
of its freedom from atmospheric pressure, through
the intervention of the bones of the skull. If this conjecture
be correct, the quantity cannot be materially increased, unless
something be displaced to make room for the addition;
nor can it be essentially diminished without something being
added to supply its place. The question turns, however,
very much on the words “materially increased or diminished;”
for a very small additional quantity may be the
cause of serious mischief, and the subtraction of even less
may give rise to great cerebral disturbance; but there can
be little doubt that the actual quantity contained in the head
is less at one time than at another, the deficiency being
usually on the side of the arteries; when congestion takes
place, it is for the most part venous. When a person is
about to faint on the first passage of a catheter through the
urethra, the blood deserts his face, he feels sick, his pulse
nearly ceases, and he would faint if he were allowed to
remain in the erect position. Let his head now be bent
down between his knees for a minute; his face fills with
blood, his brain does the same, and he recovers almost
immediately. Young ladies, when about to faint, are prevented
from doing so by these means being adopted, which
they declare, nevertheless, to be very unladylike, although
they may be doctorial and effective.</p>

<p>254. The motions of the brain covered by the dura mater
are but little observable under ordinary circumstances when
a circular portion of bone has been removed by the trephine;
the surface of the dura mater remains in general perfectly
<span class="allsmcap">LEVEL</span>; it is of a reddish-silvery color, and is firmly attached
to the cut edge of the bone. The surface is raised, however,
on a full expiration, and it falls on a deep inspiration. Fluid
secreted or placed upon it is seen to move synchronously
with the pulse; but the dura mater never rises up into the
hole made by the removal of the bone, unless some fluid be
retained beneath it. If the quantity of fluid extravasated
or collected under it be large, it rises immediately on the
removal of the bone; but the protrusion of this membrane
does not always take place for some hours afterward if the
fluid be more diffused. The motions of the brain, when the
dura mater is thus protruded into the opening, become very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
indistinct, even if they can be perceived. These two points,
viz., the protrusion into the opening and the absence of pulsation,
are important facts, little noticed by surgical writers,
to be borne in mind in connection with the practice to be
pursued.</p>

<p>If we sometimes see the natural and ordinary size of the
brain diminished under pressure, and that certain symptoms,
such as insensibility, syncope, convulsions, and paralysis, are
consequent on this state, and are relieved by the removal of
the pressure and the restoration of the compressed brain to
its ordinary state, we may safely conclude that some derangement
takes place in its integral parts, which may be best
understood by the word compression. If we further consider
that compression can rarely exist without irritation,
and that sometimes of a formidable nature, there does not
appear to be so much difficulty in the subject as is frequently
represented, although the physiological explanation may not
be so simple. In the present state of our knowledge, we
apprehend that in many cases approaching to apoplexy, in
which the symptoms are similar to those arising from compression,
all, or nearly all, the vessels, as far as we can ascertain,
are actually full of blood, instead of being partially
empty and containing less than the natural quantity. When
we see a patient, lying in a state of insensibility with a fracture
of the cranium, immediately recover his senses after the
application of the trephine and the removal of a large coagulum
of blood, we are apt to suppose that the coagulum of
blood and the insensibility stand in the relation to each other
of cause and effect. It is not unreasonable to conclude that
the pressure of the extravasated blood confined by the bone
had occasioned the insensibility, and that this did not depend
alone upon some few vessels containing less blood than
usual; for the brain must be considered as a whole in all
these investigations, and reference should not be made to its
vascular structures only in explanation of the cause of its
derangements.</p>

<p>255. When compression of the brain is caused by an
extravasation of blood, the patient is insensible, breathes
slowly, loudly, and in a heavy, labored manner, or with stertor,
and cannot be awakened, although the noisy breathing
may be for a time suspended. The breath is sometimes
emitted from the corner of the mouth, like a whiff or puff of
smoke, and with something of a similar noise: this, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
permanent, is a more dangerous symptom than the common
snoring or stertorous breathing. He sometimes froths at
the mouth, and occasionally appears convulsed, but neither
hears nor sees, nor takes the least notice of those about him.
The countenance is generally flushed if the shock or blow
has been slight, pale or livid if it should have been great.
The pulse is usually slower than natural, sometimes irregular
or intermitting, occasionally quick, even from the receipt of
the injury. The pupils of the eyes may be contracted or
dilated, being dependent for their condition more perhaps
on the part of the brain affected than on the degree of injury.
They are generally more contracted in the first instance than
dilated; they may afterward pass into a medium or doubtful
state; one may be even dilated, and the other not. In
general, as the mischief is continued and augmented, they
become dilated and immovable. The eyes may be turned
upward, or may be fixed in the center, or be drawn irregularly
outward or inward, causing strabismus, which is, however,
a more rare occurrence. If the eyelids should be partially
open, tickling the cilia or the conjunctiva of the ball
with a straw or a feather will cause them to close, if the
spinal cord be sound. The mouth and lips are more or less
compressed, and fluids run out at the corners, unless placed
on the very back of the tongue by a long, narrow spoon,
when they are swallowed with difficulty. Paralysis of one
side of the face and hemiplegia are common; paraplegia is
more rare. In both kinds of palsy one part in one limb may
be more completely affected than another, in which convulsive
twitchings are sometimes present, as well as a frequent
drawing up of the limb of the unaffected side. Tickling the
soles of the feet or the palms of the hands will sometimes
cause retraction of the toes or fingers when the limbs are
apparently motionless; pricking them gently with a pin will
often give rise to convulsive startings and tremblings of all
the muscles of the extremity when tickling fails, showing
that the capability to move the part remains, although the
will to do so is wanting. The leg or arm is sometimes
drawn toward the body when separated from it; it more
often falls from the hand as if it belonged to the body of a
dead person; the muscles are occasionally more stiff and
rigid, and some power of motion remains, although but little
of sensation; sometimes sensation is perfect when motion is
lost, and sensation may be lost on one side and motion on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
the other. The urine at first retained may ultimately pass
involuntarily, as well as the feces; nevertheless, irritating
the verge of the anus will excite motion and contraction in
the sphincter ani, if the functions of the spinal cord be not
destroyed. The action of the involuntary muscles is little
impaired in general, and the secretions are but slightly
affected; when it is otherwise, the injury must have extended
to the ganglionic system, and the whole of the nervous
centers must be materially implicated.</p>

<p>The loss of motion, or of the power of moving parts of
the body, is either perfect or imperfect according to the degree
of injury which has been inflicted, varying from a sense
of feebleness to an almost utter incapability of moving the
part. It is accompanied in general by defective sensation,
or numbness, or by the complete loss of sensation and of the
power of resisting heat and cold; the whole side, or one extremity,
or a part only of an extremity may be affected, and
not the whole. The mischief which gives rise to the loss of
motion usually occurs on the side of the brain opposite to
that part of the body which is paralytic. This was known
and stated by Hippocrates, and the subject has been pursued
to the most complete demonstration by modern anatomists.</p>

<p>The pathological proofs are not less complete. Desault
and Bichat were by no means satisfied that the paralysis
which followed an injury always took place on the opposite
side; and some pathologists since their time, while admitting
the fact, have shown that there may be exceptions. It
is acknowledged, although it is not clearly and satisfactorily
accounted for as to the face, that an extravasation of blood
into one hemisphere of the cerebrum, or even of the cerebellum,
can cause paralysis of the complete half of the body
on the opposite side. It has been demonstrated that the
right side of the body and the left side of the face may be
paralytic at the same time and from the same injury apparently
of the left side of the head, the mischief which caused
the paralysis of the right side being found, in by far the
greater number of instances, on the left side of the brain,
and that which gave rise to the paralysis of the left side of
the face to have been caused by an injury in the course of
the portio dura of the seventh pair of nerves when about to
leave, or after it had left, the brain.</p>

<p>Burdach found, in 268 cases of lesion of one side of the
brain, that 10 presented paralysis on both sides of the body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
and 250 of one side; in 15 of these the paralysis was on
the same side as the injury. Convulsions took place in 25
cases on the same side as the disease; in 3, on the opposite
side. In cases of lesion of one corpus striatum, there were,
in 36 instances, paralysis of the opposite side, and 6 with
convulsions of the same side, and in no instance convulsions
of the opposite side. In 28 cases of cerebral lesion of one
side, the muscles of the opposite side of the face were paralyzed;
in 10, those of the same side. Paralysis of the
eyelid was in 6 cases on the same side, in 5 on the opposite
side. Paralysis of the muscles of the eyeball occurred in 8
cases on the same side, in 4 on the opposite; paralysis of
the iris, in 5 cases on the same side and in 5 on the opposite,
the tongue being generally drawn toward the paralyzed
side of the face.</p>

<p>A man fell down stairs and received an injury on the head
from the fall which rendered him nearly insensible at the
moment. There were no signs or appearances on the outside
of the head indicative of any serious mischief, nor were
any found on examination after death. The pulse was quick,
and rose to 140; the left side was paralytic; the breathing
not stertorous, but accompanied by a little puff on the right
side of the mouth; the pupils somewhat dilated; he could
not speak, convulsions supervened, and he died the day afterward.
On dissection, the peculiar flatness of the convolutions
of the brain on the right side was so remarkable,
when compared with that of the left, as to leave little doubt
of its having been occasioned by something which had pressed
them forcibly upward against the inside of the cranium; and,
on slicing off a portion of the brain, a larger coagulum of
blood was found below than is usually observed to exist without
the almost immediate death of the patient. The same
thing has been so distinctly marked in other instances that no
doubt can be entertained of those convolutions of the brain
which were situated between the coagulum and the cranium
having undergone a considerable degree of compression. It
is worthy of remark that the pulse of this person was always
regular and remarkably quick from the first examination
after the receipt of the injury until the period of his death,
showing, perhaps, that the action of the heart is not affected
directly by pressure acting only on the upper surface of the
brain.</p>

<p>256. Convulsive actions of the muscles, or positive con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>vulsive
fits, are always important symptoms; yet they seem
in some persons to be dependent on idiosyncrasy, particularly
when they appear early, and after the loss of blood, in
which case they are less dangerous. They occur at different
periods after the receipt of the injury, and have been
supposed to depend in general upon laceration of the substance
of the brain, although experiments on animals would
seem to show that they may be caused directly by irritation
of the cerebro-spinal axis within the skull, in which case the
patients are more likely to recover. They have been observed
particularly on the side opposite to that which is
paralytic, so as to give rise to the idea that the paralysis is
dependent on injury of one side of the cerebrum, and convulsions
on injury of the other. When the effect of the
mischief is so great as to cause complete paralysis, convulsive
twitches do not take place, although they frequently
precede, and may in many cases be considered as premonitory
signs, while the evil which gives rise to the paralysis is
gradually accumulating. When the paralysis is not complete,
the side so affected suffers sometimes from slight convulsive
twitches, while well-marked spasms prevail in the
other, leading to the belief that, while paralysis is an affection
of only half the brain of the opposite side, or of half
the spinal marrow of the same side, convulsions are the effect
of a more general irritation, capable, however, of being confined
to a part; for partial convulsive motions do very frequently
occur without any paralysis accompanying them on
the opposite side. Several cases have occurred in which
the convulsions have ceased, and the patients recovered after
the removal of a portion of bone which was irritating the
brain; but convulsions have generally been the forerunners
of death when the seat of injury was unknown and effective
relief could not be given. When they occur in cases apparently
of pure concussion, accompanied by inflammation of the
brain or of its membranes, and the patient recovers after many
days of the strictest antiphlogistic treatment, it is possible that
the brain may have been lacerated, and the cure have been
effected by adhesion. Convulsions, it must be remarked, are
among the most common symptoms of inflammation of the
membranes of the brain, without any such lesion of its substance,
although they are frequently wanting. They may be
expected to take place about and after the fifth day in injuries
of the head, when inflammation of the brain or of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
membranes is about to extend to or to become continuous
with the neighboring parts, and may be more or less severe,
varying from a state of partial trembling of a limb to that
of general agitation and restlessness of the body generally&mdash;from
a slight, irregular movement of the eyelids, or of the
muscles of the face, to the more marked spasmodic startings
of the whole of one side, grinding of the teeth, and contraction
of the limbs. It is far different with those convulsive
movements which, at a late period, become nearly permanent,
or with rigid spasms, resembling tetanus, in which
the body is drawn in different directions, forward, backward,
or to one side. These are for the most part forerunners of
death. Examination after death, in such cases, has frequently
shown nothing discoverable beyond inflammation of
the pia mater, and an effusion of fluid, generally purulent,
on the surface of the brain, or in its ventricles, or between
the pia mater and the tunica arachnoides.</p>

<p>The three following cases are intended to show the different
forms of paralysis that ensue after injuries accompanied
by compression or irritation of the brain:&mdash;</p>

<p>Charles Murray, private in the 2d battalion of 1st Foot
Guards, aged thirty-three, was wounded on the 18th of June,
at Waterloo, by a piece of shell which struck him on the
superior part of the <i>left</i> parietal bone. He remained insensible
about half an hour, and on recovering from that
state, was affected with nausea and some bleeding from the
left ear, and found himself unable to move his <i>right</i> arm
and <i>right</i> leg, which hung as if they were dead, and had
lost their feeling. Admitted into the Minimes General
Hospital at Antwerp on the 29th; he suffered much from
pain in the head, which was relieved by his being twice
bled. The paralytic affection having remained without
change from the moment he was wounded, a piece of the
parietal bone, about three-fourths of an inch long, and
several smaller fragments, were extracted four days after
admission into the hospital, two perforations with the trephine
having been necessary. Immediately after the removal
of the bone he recovered the use of his right arm and
leg, so far as to be able to move them, and to be sensible of
their being touched. He gradually recovered by the 14th
of August, so as to be sent to the General Hospital at Yarmouth,
never having had a bad symptom, the only defect
remaining on the right side being an inability to grasp any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>thing
in his hand with force. The pulsation of the brain was
still visible at the bottom of the wound for about the space of
half the circumference of the crown of the trephine. September
16th, 1815: the wound has filled up with healthy granulations,
and has nearly cicatrized. A small sinus remains at
the superior part, through which the edge of the bone can
be felt. His health has been invariably good, although he
has suffered a good deal of pain twice previously to the
coming away of little pieces of bone, and toward evening
he has been generally subject to slight vertigo. Discharged
cured.</p>

<p>William Mitchel, of the Royals, aged forty, was wounded
by a musket-ball on the 18th of June, at Waterloo; it struck
the side of the head near the vertex, and, passing across
through the sagittal suture, fractured and depressed <i>both</i>
parietal bones. When he had recovered his senses he suffered
great pain in the part, and found that he had lost the
use of BOTH his legs, and was benumbed even from the loins
and lower part of the chest; he was often sick, and felt low
and ill. On the 28th, ten days after the battle, the trephine
was applied in two places, and the whole of the detached
and depressed portions of bone were removed. The sickness,
lowness of spirits, and general illness immediately subsided,
and the loss of power in the lower extremities gradually
began to diminish, but he was not able to walk without
assistance until the first week in August. On the 10th he
arrived at Yarmouth, not having had a bad symptom after
the depressed bone had been removed; and by the end of
September he was discharged, able to walk well with the
assistance of a stick.</p>

<p>Mr. Keate has mentioned to me a case, in which the injury
and the paralysis were apparently on the same, or the right
side. The paralysis, although positive, was not so complete
as to render the patient quite incapable of moving the arm
and leg, which were frequently convulsed, but the convulsions,
which were observable in both, were more marked on
the opposite or left side. On examination after death, the
most serious injury was found to be a fracture of the right
parietal and temporal bones, extending to the petrous portion
of the latter, and beyond it; this, with a rather large
extravasation of blood under and in the course of the fracture,
appeared to be sufficient not only to destroy life, but
to have caused paralysis of the left side, which, however, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
did not do. Another extravasation, rather less in quantity,
had, however, taken place under the upper and anterior
portion of the left parietal bone, which enabled Mr. Keate
fully to account for the paralysis which took place on the
right side. According to the surgery of the French Academicians
of the beginning of the eighteenth century, this
man would have been trephined or trepanned on the left
side of the head in search of an extravasation by contre-coup;
but accident or chance alone could have led to the
right spot, as it was by no means opposed to that on the
other side.</p>

<p>257. A simple fissure or fracture of the skull is of no
more importance than a fracture of any other bone in the
body, unless it implicate the brain; it should be managed
according to the ordinary principles of surgery. These
principles, however, involve a treatment diametrically opposite
to that practiced by many surgeons, almost unto the
present day.</p>

<p>If the integuments or scalp be divided, and the bone fissured,
these principles should be carried out, by endeavoring
to procure the union of the divided parts, as was generally
done during the war in all such injuries from sabre-cuts as
did not quite penetrate the skull&mdash;a practice that was found
to be eminently successful, even when union did not take
place. The general treatment should be similar to that insisted
on in concussion, of which the following may perhaps
be considered a sufficient example:&mdash;</p>

<p>A soldier in Lisbon, partly in liquor, received a blow from
a spade which cut the upper part of the head across the
sagittal suture, and rendered him senseless. He soon got
better, and a slight fissure or fracture without depression
was discovered. His head was shaved, kept raised, wet and
cold, and the divided parts brought together by sticking-plaster;
he was bled to twenty-four ounces, purged, starved,
and kept quiet in a dark room. Slept well, but said that
his head felt painful, as if something tight was tied around
it. Pulse 96, small and hard; bowels not open. Blood
was taken from the arm to the amount of forty ounces, when
he appeared about to faint. Calomel and jalap, followed by
infus. sennæ cum magnes. sulphate, were given, and acted
well, and he was greatly relieved. The calomel was continued
every six hours. In the evening, however, the pain
and tightness of the head returned, with a pulse of 110,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hard and full; these symptoms were removed by the loss of
twenty-four ounces of blood. He remained easy until the
evening of the next or the third day, when the pulse quickened
to 120, became small and hard, and he complained of
severe pain in the head. It was evident that inflammation
of the brain or of its membranes had commenced, and that
it must be subdued; he was therefore bled until he fainted,
forty ounces having been taken away. This entirely relieved
him, and calomel and jalap, senna and salts were again administered
with great effect. On the fourth day he was easy,
the pulse 94, soft and full, the mouth being tender from the
mercury. The wound did not heal by adhesion, but by
granulation; and under the continuance of the starving and
purging system he gradually got well without any more bad
symptoms, having been saved by the loss of one hundred
and twenty-eight ounces of blood in three days.</p>

<p>The vigorous and decided abstraction of blood saved the
man, and, with the mercury, in all probability prevented the
occurrence of those evils which our predecessors sought to
obviate by removing a portion of bone. They believed the
bone could not be fractured without an extravasation taking
place beneath; and some took credit to themselves for placing
wedges between the broken edges, in order to allow the
escape of the blood or of the matter which might be formed
below it. That blood may be effused, and matter may be
formed, is indisputable, even under the most active treatment;
but that an operation by the trephine will anticipate
and prevent these evils, cannot be conceded in the present
state of our knowledge; and the rule of practice is at present
decided, that no such operation should be done until symptoms
supervene distinctly announcing that compression or
irritation of the brain has taken place. It is argued that
when these symptoms do occur, it will be too late to have
recourse to the operation with success. This may be true, as
such cases must always be very dangerous; but it does not
follow, and it never has been, nor indeed can it be shown,
that the same mischief would not have taken place, if the
operation had been performed early.</p>

<p>258. When a simple fracture, which in its slightest form
is called a capillary fissure, takes place, the dura mater must
be separated from it at that part to a certain extent, and
some small vessels must be torn through. It does not follow,
however, that blood must necessarily be poured out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
such a quantity that it will not be absorbed. Dissection, on
the contrary, has established the fact that it will be absorbed
even in cases of fracture of greater extent, where it has been
seen that a larger quantity had been extravasated. As the
effusion of a larger, or of so large a quantity of blood as to
prove eventually mischievous, does not <i>usually</i> take place,
except under other circumstances than those of a simple
fracture, the ordinary practice ought not to be to seek for
that which is not likely to be found. The dura mater is
rarely separated beyond the limits of the fracture, and it is
more likely to recover without any further exposure or interference
than with it. The dura mater, however, may be
separated to a considerable extent from the bone in more
severe injuries, and a quantity of blood is often extravasated
upon it. When this does occur, the commotion or shock
which occasioned the fracture, the separation of the dura
mater, and the extravasation will generally have caused
other more important although less perceptible derangements.
These show themselves after the lapse of a few
days, by giving rise to inflammation of the brain or of its
membranes, of which such patients more usually die, than of
the separation of the dura mater, or of the extravasation of
a small quantity of blood. The case is no longer one of
simple fissure or fracture of the cranium, and the nature and
severity of the symptoms which have supervened must regulate
the practice to be pursued.</p>

<p>259. After the receipt of a severe blow, or of a gunshot
fracture of the head, which has not even stunned the person
at the moment, he may walk to the surgeon, the wound be
dressed, and he may converse with his fellows as if nothing
had happened; yet in a short time he may become heavy,
stupid, drowsy, and unwilling to move, with a slow pulse and
a pallid countenance. Inflammation has not yet had time to
set in, and extravasation has not always taken place. If
the loss of a moderate quantity of blood should relieve such
a person, it shows that congestion had occurred, perhaps on
the surface of the brain under the injured spot, on recovering
from which, by the unassisted efforts of nature, he would
still be liable to inflammation. I have repeatedly seen a
sharp bleeding from an incision made to allow a complete
examination of the part in such a case, cause the restoration
of the patient to his natural state. A return of untoward
symptoms during the progress of the case does not always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
indicate essential mischief; they will be removed, if of a
temporary nature, by a further moderate bleeding, by purgatives,
and by greater restriction in diet, through irregularities
in which these secondary attacks most usually occur. If
the loss of blood should not relieve the symptoms, the case
is probably complicated by a separation of the dura mater,
or by an extravasation having taken place between the
dura mater and the bone, or even in or on the surface of the
brain.</p>

<p>260. When a fracture takes place at the anterior inferior
angle of the parietal bone, or in any part of the course of
the middle meningeal artery, it often gives rise to a more
serious injury, which nothing but an operation can remove.
The artery is always in a groove, and is often even imbedded
in the bone at its lower part, and may be torn at the moment
of fracture, giving rise to a gradual extravasation of blood
on the surface of the brain, which can be borne to a considerable
extent without causing any particular symptoms, although
a sudden and considerable effusion causes immediate
insensibility. When the extravasation is gradual, the patient
walks away after the accident, and converses freely, becoming
oppressed slowly, and in the end insensible, as the last drops
of blood which are effused render the compression effective.
When these symptoms occur after a wound in this particular
part, the bone should be immediately examined; if there be
no obvious fracture, and relief cannot be obtained by the
abstraction of blood, the trephine should be resorted to as a
last resource; for if there be truth in the statements so confidently
made of fracture of the inner table of the bone from
concussion of the outer without fracture, it is here especially
that we may be permitted to look for it. The hemorrhage
in the greater number of these cases takes place slowly, and
the effused blood depresses the brain by separating the dura
mater from the neighboring bone&mdash;a process, however, which
can hardly occur unless the injury has been so violent as to
rupture its attachments to the bone; for the brain generally
yields rather than the attachments of the dura mater, and is
depressed, the hollow or cavity thus formed being filled up
by the coagulum, which becomes thicker and thicker until
insensibility is induced. Blood effused between the dura
mater and the bone readily fills up in the first instance all
the space formed by the disruption of the membrane; for
the force with which the blood is poured out from the artery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
overcomes the resistance offered by the brain, which gradually
yields and sinks unto that point at which its natural functions
can no longer be carried on. If the attachments of the
dura mater be strong, and the separation which has taken
place between it and the bone be small, the blood effused is
compressed by the bone on one side, on which it can exert
no influence, and is resisted by the dura mater, which will
recede no further on the other. The wounded artery in such
a case is soon compressed by its own coagulum, and the
effusion is comparatively trifling, giving rise, according to
its nature, either to the primary symptoms of compression
from extravasation, or to the secondary ones dependent in
all probability on inflammation and suppuration of the part,
and of irritation and compression of the brain beneath. If,
on the contrary, the separation of the dura mater from the
bone be extensive, the quantity of extravasated blood may
be considerable and the brain will be greatly depressed.
Experience has demonstrated that persons have recovered
after large coagula have been removed; but in all these
cases the brain had not lost its resiliency, and was seen to
regain its natural level on the removal of the depressing
cause, the person often opening his eyes and recognizing
and speaking to those about him; but this does not take
place when the brain remains depressed after the blood has
been removed.</p>

<p>A French artillery driver was knocked off his horse by a
musket-ball, which struck him on the anterior and inferior
portion of the right parietal bone, during a charge made by
General Brennier, at the battle of Vimiera, on the British
infantry under the command of the late Sir Ronald Fergusson.
I took him under my care, thinking from his freedom
from bad symptoms and the slightness of the fracture that
he would probably do well. The next morning I found him
apparently dying. A portion of bone being removed, a
thick coagulum of blood appeared beneath, apparently extending
in every direction. Three more pieces of bone were
taken away and the coagulum, which appeared to be an
inch in thickness, was removed with difficulty with the help
of a feather. The brain did not, however, regain its level,
and the man shortly after died. The middle meningeal
artery was torn across on the outside of the dura mater;
the wound did not pass through to the inside, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
no blood beneath the dura mater. The convolutions of the
brain were depressed and flattened by the pressure.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 29th Regiment was struck on the right
parietal bone in a similar manner, shortly after daylight, at
the battle of Talavera, during the first attack on the hill,
the key of the British position. He walked to me soon
afterward to the place where the wounded of the evening
before had been collected in the rear. Being otherwise employed,
I heard his story but could not attend to him at the
moment, and found him some time afterward insensible, with
a slow, intermitting pulse, breathing loudly, and supposed
to be dying. The fractured parts were sufficiently broken
to admit of the introduction of two elevators, by means of
which they were gradually removed, together with a large
coagulum of blood which had depressed the brain. When
this had been done the brain regained its level, the man
opened his eyes, looked around, knew and thanked me. The
pulse and breathing became regular; he said he suffered
only a little pain in the part, and should soon get well. He
died, however, on the third day.</p>

<p>During the battle of Salamanca a soldier of the 27th
Regiment was brought to me, who had walked to the rear,
and had fallen down insensible within a few yards of the
hospital station. I found a considerable fracture, with depression
at the inferior part of the parietal bone before and
above the ear. The end of the elevator having been introduced,
a small piece of bone was first raised, then another,
and a third, when a thick coagulum was exposed and removed.
The dura mater was not separated from the bone
around to any extent, and the coagulum, although thick, was
not large. The brain, which had been depressed, regained
its level immediately; the man recovered his senses, and was
cured of his wound, but remained unfit for service. The
artery did not bleed after it had been exposed.</p>

<p>The rule in surgery, to remove the bone in such cases, is
absolute.</p>

<p>261. Fractures of the skull are stated, from almost the
earliest records of surgery, to occur on one <i>side</i> of the head
in consequence of blows received on the <i>other</i>. The facts
which ancient authors have collected and related on this
point are so numerous and so well attested that it appears
almost more than skeptical to doubt their accuracy, however
seldom they may be now observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
A counter-fracture or fissure of one parietal or temporal
bone, caused by a blow on the opposite one, is of such rare
occurrence that it is in general unnoticed by later writers
on injuries of the head. It is not so, however, with respect
to a fracture at the base of the cranium from a blow on the
vertex, or on the back part of the head&mdash;a kind of accident
which occurs more frequently perhaps than any other in civil
life&mdash;because persons who suffer from fractures of the skull
do so more generally by falling from a height, or from being
pitched on their heads, than by direct blows or other injuries.
This accident principally depends on the superincumbent
weight of the body pressing on the unsupported flat and
thin base of the skull, and is but little connected with the
unyielding nature of the spine; for it occurs to as great an
extent in consequence of falls from a short distance without
any impetus, as from falls from a great height. Some of the
worst cases take place by the sufferer having been thrown
from the back of a horse by the sudden starting of the
animal, without any running away. Although in these cases
a fissure may often be traced to the foramen magnum, the
great fracture is essentially distinct, extending from the
petrous portion of the temporal bone on each side, across,
and between the sphenoid bone and the os frontis, and even
separating the edges of the coronal suture nearly to the
opposite side.</p>

<p>A noted gambler was thrown from his horse, and pitched
on the top of his head at the door of the Westminster Hospital,
late at night; he was taken up insensible, and died
shortly afterward. The skull was fractured quite round
from the vertex to the base, and from side to side, so that
the fore and back parts might have been easily separated
into halves, if the soft parts had been removed. Fractures
of the base of the cranium are generally fatal, but not always
so; for some persons live a considerable time afterward, and
appear to die from other causes; so that partial, if not perfect
recovery is possible.</p>

<p>H. Cochrane, forty-five years of age, fell a distance of
twenty feet upon his head, and was taken up apparently
lifeless, bleeding largely from the ears, nose, and mouth, but
more particularly from the ears. He was seen within half
an hour of the accident. He was then quite insensible;
the surface of the body cold; pulse about 68, and very
feeble; in three hours after the accident he was bled to six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>teen
ounces, when his pulse rose to 76, and the breathing,
which before was rather oppressed, became more free. He
was ordered six grains of calomel, followed by moderate
doses of senna, till the bowels should be relieved.</p>

<p>He continued progressively mending, but in a state of stupidity,
accompanied by extreme listlessness; answered questions
sullenly, and frequently rested upon one arm without
appearing conscious of pain; the mouth was drawn to the
left side, to which there had been a slight tendency for some
days; the tongue not at all affected.</p>

<p>He continued under treatment for three weeks longer,
soon after which he was permitted to resume his employment,
the mouth being still drawn in some degree to the left side.
His habits became silent and solitary, but he performed his
task with the greatest exactness. He was occasionally subject
to vertigo, particularly in hot weather, after any violent
exertion or taking a small quantity of beer; a pint of ale
would render him stupid or insensible. Six months afterward
he was found dead, lying in a ditch.</p>

<p><i>Sectio cadaveris.</i>&mdash;The nasal bones were fractured by a
blow which had made a transverse incision in the upper part
of the face. The femur was found fractured upon the right
side, and the scalp puffy and ecchymosed on the left. On
removing the skull-cap, the dura mater appeared perfectly
healthy, without any sign of extravasated blood upon the
surface. Beneath the pia mater on the left side the sulci of
the brain were filled with black blood, apparently very recently
effused. The brain was removed without the least
violence, when a lesion was found upon its inferior surface,
corresponding to the petrous portion of the right temporal
bone. The dura mater in this situation was externally of
its natural structure, and adhered with its usual degree of
firmness to the bone beneath. The arachnoid and pia mater
were here deficient; the lesion consisted of a cavity about
fifteen lines in length, nine in breadth, and three in depth,
coated with a light-yellow lining, which also adhered to the
corresponding portion of the inner surface of the dura mater,
which completed the walls of the cavity inferiorly; it contained
a turbid serum, in which were seen floating numerous
but exceedingly minute white globules. The portion of the
brain in this situation did not appear to have been disturbed
by the recent violence, except that from the upper part of the
cavity a probe was admitted without any resistance into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
descending horn of the right lateral ventricle, which, with the
one on the opposite side, was filled with a large quantity of
bloody serum, none of which, however, had escaped into the
cavity beneath. The brain generally appeared perfectly
healthy, and not more vascular than usual. Even within a
line of the yellow deposit above mentioned there appeared
not the slightest change of structure. On removing the
dura mater from the base of the skull, indications of a former
fracture were discovered, leading vertically down through the
squamous portion of the temporal bone, whence it appeared
to have been continued along the anterior part of the petrous
portion into the Vidian canal; the edges of this fracture,
both internally and externally, had been rounded by absorption;
it was met at right angles by another which ran across
the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone. The
direction of the last fracture was marked by numerous small,
rough particles of bone, which adhered so slightly to the rest
that they separated on maceration. The transverse ligament
of the second vertebra was ruptured, and the atlas forced forward.
The connection between the articular processes of
the second and third cervical vertebræ on the right side had
also been separated by the fall which had caused death.</p>

<p>William Clayton, forty-four years of age, was admitted on
the 31st of July, 1841, into the Westminster Hospital, having
received a blow on the <span class="allsmcap">RIGHT</span> side of his head from the
handle of a windlass, by which his skull was fractured. The
fracture extended downward from the parietal bone across
the temporal, and in all probability through its petrous portion,
as blood flowed freely from the ear for the first six
hours; he was stunned for a few minutes at first, but became
sensible by the time he was brought to the hospital. The
bleeding from the ear was followed by the discharge of a fluid
resembling water&mdash;which is a very dangerous symptom, as it
usually flows from the sac of the arachnoid membrane&mdash;and
afterward at intervals by a discharge of blood and matter,
particularly, he said, on coughing; he was also quite deaf,
with a little pain on the right side of the head. The bowels
were well opened, and he lost sixteen ounces of blood. On
the evening of the third of August, the fourth day after the
accident, paralysis of the muscles of the <span class="allsmcap">RIGHT</span> side of the
face supplied by the portio dura came on, or was first observed.
Pulse 80. He was well purged, but lost no
blood, as he was apparently weak and the pulse soft; it fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
next day to 72. Mercury was now administered twice a
day until the mouth became sore. On the eighteenth of
September he was discharged, cured of the paralysis, the
wound on the head being open, and a piece of bone bare and
likely to exfoliate. October 8. Readmitted in consequence
of great headache after drunkenness, with numbness of the
toes and fingers; he was well purged, and felt relieved. He
remained in the hospital for a month, his mouth being again
slightly affected, occasionally drinking in spite of all remonstrance;
he then returned to his work on the piers of Westminster
bridge. On the eighth of June several small pieces
of bone came away; and the wound nearly healed. The
course of the fracture can be traced, in consequence of the
scalp having adhered to the bone, causing a slight depression
and hardness, which can be felt by the finger, extending
down to the ear.</p>

<p>An hostler was thrown on his head from a horse, and was
carried to the Westminster Hospital late at night in a state
of stupefaction; no other injury could be discovered. The
next morning he could answer questions, although not always
correctly; complained of pain in his head, had bled from the
ears all night, and had vomited some blood two or three
times. Pupils dilated, but they contracted on bringing a
lighted candle near them; the left eyelid more open than
the right; pulse 52; very restless, and constantly turning in
bed. V. S. ad ℥xxiv. Calomel and colocynth: salts and
senna. Cold to the head. The pulse rose to 60 after the
loss of blood. 2d day. Is delirious; bleeding from the
ears but trifling; complains of pain in the head; bowels
open; passes urine freely; pulse 54, a little irregular.
Y. S. ad ℥xvj gave relief. Continue calomel, and salts and
senna. 3d day. Restless all night; headache and thirst;
bowels open. V. S. ad ℥xiv relieved the pain in the head.
Pulse 56. 4th day. Restless and delirious at night; pulse
60, regular; bowels open; headache. V. S. ad ℥xiv. No
discharge from the ears. 6th day. Slightly paralytic on
the left side of the face, tongue drawn to that side; headache,
restless, delirious; feces and urine passed unconsciously;
pulse 80. V. S. ad ℥xx. Pulse rose to 100, and was weaker.
Calomel, gr. iii every six hours. 7th day. Pulse 88, compressible;
restless at all times, delirious at night; bowels
open, but he is more conscious of everything. 8th day.
Pulse 80, small, intermitting; occasionally slept a little, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
is generally better; bowels well purged; paralysis of the
face continues. Has taken a little farinaceous food. Continue
calomel and inf. sennæ. 10th day. Improved; slept
tolerably well. 12th day. Continues to improve. Omit
the calomel, but continue the infus. sennæ. 16th day. Is
better. Paralysis lessened. Recollects he was thrown from
a horse, but nothing else. Is free from pain, but very weak.
Mouth a little sore.</p>

<p>After this time he gradually recovered, but was for a long
time unable to work, or to undergo any exposure. A very
little more mischief, and he would have gradually sunk, and
died after the seventh day, instead of slowly recovering.</p>

<p class="h2sub">INJURIES OF THE HEAD.</p>

<p>262. A fracture of the inner or vitreous table of the
skull, as it has been termed from its peculiar brittleness, as
opposed to the greater toughness of the outer, is a rare
occurrence without some signs of depression or fracture of
the outer table, or detachment of the pericranium.</p>

<p>Mr. S. Cooper says: “One case of this kind, attended
with urgent symptoms of compression, I trephined at Brussels.
A large splinter of the inner table was driven more
than an inch into the brain, and on its extraction the patient’s
senses and power of voluntary motion instantly returned.
The part of the skull to which the trephine was
applied did not indicate externally any depression, although
the external table came away in the hollow of the trephine,
leaving the inner table behind.”</p>

<p>The records of eighteen centuries have produced but little
information on this most interesting subject: and if the
cases were collected which have been overlooked by authors,
as well as those which have been altogether omitted, little
would be gained; it may be concluded, therefore, that
although such things have happened, they are of rare occurrence.
I have never, in the great number of broken
heads I have had under my care on many different and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
grand occasions, actually known the inner table to be separated
from the outer, without positive marks of an injury
having been inflicted on the bone or pericranium. Although
it is not possible to doubt the fact of fracture of the inner
table having occurred, without apparent injury to the outer,
it is very desirable in a practical point of view not to bear
it too strongly in mind; for if a surgeon should be prepossessed
with the idea that the inner table may be so readily
fractured and separated from the diploe placed between it
and the outer table, and thus cause irritation or pressure on
the brain, few persons who had received a knock on the
head, followed by any serious symptoms, without fracture or
depression, would escape the trephine, and the worst practice
would be again established. An operation should never
be performed under the expectation that such an accident
may have happened, unless it be apparently required by the
urgency of the symptoms indicating compression or irritation
of the brain, which cannot be relieved by other means,
and are about to prove fatal.</p>

<p>It is by no means intended to imply by these remarks
that a blow on the head will not frequently detach the dura
mater from the inner table by rupturing its vessels, and thus
give rise to compression or irritation of the brain from the
effusion of blood or the formation of matter; or that the
inner table may not from the same cause become diseased,
and thus lead to ulterior mischief; but these are altogether
different states of injury, and require a different consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Deane, of Chatteris, in Cambridgeshire, had occasion
to examine the head of a young man after death from a
blow on the left side, just below the parietal protuberance,
there being only a <i>slight detachment</i> of the pericranium,
but no fracture. On removing the skull-cap, a very distinct
fracture of the inner table, about three-quarters of an
inch long, was seen corresponding to the external part injured,
extending outwardly as far as the diploe, but no
farther. The dura mater adhered firmly everywhere, except
at this part, and for some distance around, a quantity
of fluid blood being interposed between it and the bone. If
this man had outlived the first symptoms, he would not, in
all probability, have recovered without an operation for the
removal of the extravasated blood.</p>

<p>263. Severe effects do not always take place in such cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
in the course of the first treatment, but occur afterward; or
the unfavorable symptoms, never having been entirely removed,
increase so much at a later period as to render the
aid of operative surgery necessary for the removal of the
bone, in order to save life.</p>

<p>M. A. Farnham, aged twenty-three, a stout, healthy-looking
girl, received a blow, two years before, from a stone
falling from a door-way under which she was passing; it
struck her upon the left side of the head at a spot an inch
anterior to the parietal prominence, the weight of the stone
and the space through which it fell making the estimated
force with which it struck the head equal to sixteen pounds.
The immediate effect of the blow was insensibility, followed
by acute fixed pain in the head, which has ever since continued
to mark the seat of injury. A week after the receipt
of the blow she began to lose the power of moving the right
arm, there being, however, no loss of sensation or any disturbance
of the cerebral functions.</p>

<p>During the following twelve mouths the symptoms remained
unchanged; this period was spent in several London
hospitals; not having derived any relief while in any of
these institutions, she became an out-patient of the Westminster
Hospital.</p>

<p>The arm and leg of the right side were quite paralytic,
the former, which had previously been flaccid, having now
become remarkably rigid, its temperature being below that
of the opposite side; vision, particularly of the left eye, imperfect,
the pupils, however, acting naturally; hearing on
that side also affected; memory bad; respiration frequently
slow and almost stertorous; the countenance had assumed
a dull, heavy expression, and she manifested an unusual
tendency to sleep.</p>

<p>April 1st, 1841.&mdash;Mr. Guthrie this day removed a disk
of bone from the exact point in the parietal region to which
she referred the pain. The portion of bone presented no
evidence of disease; its thickness varied from two and a half
to four lines, the latter measurement corresponding to the
part most distant from the sagittal suture; the vessels of the
diploe bled freely, the dura mater was quite healthy, and
without any very evident motion.</p>

<p>On visiting her <i>an hour</i> after the operation, she raised
the previously paralytic arm several inches from the bed,
and was able to bend and extend the fingers. The pain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the head was considerably less, and her countenance, before
dull and heavy, was now remarkably animated. Sensation
had returned in the arm, and partially in the leg. Her
pulse was calm, and the skin cool.</p>

<p>Ten hours after the operation she was attacked with
rigors, followed by pyrexia and all the symptoms of commencing
inflammation of the brain. By the immediate
abstraction of blood, which was three times repeated during
the succeeding twelve hours, whenever the pain in the head
or the force of the circulation increased, every bad symptom
was removed. In the course of three days the paralysis had
completely disappeared, sight and hearing again became
perfect, and after passing through a speedy convalescence,
she quitted the hospital completely recovered.</p>

<p>She has since had some relapses of pain and uneasiness in
the head, but is altogether a different person, although of a
very hysterical temperament. The cicatrix on the head is
firm, and she considers herself to have been cured by the
operation.</p>

<p>264. The inner table is sometimes broken in a peculiar
manner, and to this attention was first drawn in my lectures,
since trepanning has ceased to be the rule of practice in all
cases of fractures. It occurs from the blow of a sword,
hatchet, or other clean-cutting instrument, which strikes the
head perpendicularly, and makes one clean cut through the
scalp and skull into the brain. This kind of cut is usually
considered as a mere solution of continuity, and not as a
fracture, the bone being apparently only divided, with
scarcely any crack or fissure extending beyond the part
actually penetrated by the instrument. When the outer
table alone has been divided, the wound in the scalp should
be treated as a simple incised one, and united as quickly as
possible, a practice of which I have seen several successful
instances. When the instrument even penetrates to the
diploe, the same course should be pursued; for although the
external wound may not unite by the adhesive process, and
some small exfoliations may occur, it is not common for
serious consequences to ensue under that strictly antiphlogistic
plan of treatment to which all persons with such
injuries should be subjected.</p>

<p>265. When the sword or ax has penetrated the inner
table, the case is of a much more serious nature; for this
part will be broken almost always to a greater extent than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
the outer table. It may be separated from it, and driven
into the membranes, if not into the substance of the brain
itself, the surface of the bone showing merely a separation
of the edges of the cut made into it. These cases should all
be examined carefully. The length of the wound on the
top, or side, or any part of the head which is curved and not
flat, will readily show to what depth the sword or ax has
penetrated. A blunt or flat-ended probe should in such
cases be carefully passed into the wound, and being gently
pressed against one of the cut edges of the bone, its thickness
may be measured, and the presence or absence of the
inner table may thus be ascertained. If it should be separated
from the diploe, the continued but careful insertion of
the probe will detect it deeper in the wound. A further
careful investigation will show the extent in length of this
separation, although not in width; and will in all probability
satisfy the surgeon that those portions of bone which have
thus been broken and driven in are sticking in or irritating the
brain. In many such cases there has not been more than a
momentary stunning felt by the patient; he says he is free
from symptoms, that he is not much hurt, and is satisfied he
shall be well in a few days.</p>

<p>An officer was struck on the head, in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
by a drunken workman with a tomahawk, or small Indian
hatchet, which made a perpendicular cut into his left parietal
bone, and knocked him down. As he soon recovered from
the blow, and suffered nothing but the ordinary symptoms of
a common wound of the head with fracture, it was considered
to be a favorable case, and was treated simply, although with
sufficient precaution. He sat up, and shaved himself until
the fourteenth day, when he observed that the corner of his
mouth on the opposite side to that on which he had been
wounded was fixed, and the other drawn aside; and that he
had not the free use of the right arm so as to enable him to
shave. He was bled largely, but the symptoms increased
until he lost the use of the right side, became comatose, and
died. On examination, the inner table was found broken,
separated from the diploe, and driven through the membranes
into the brain, which was at that part soft, yellow, and in a
state of suppuration.</p>

<p>Mr. B., of the 29th Regiment, when in Halifax, Nova Scotia,
was struck, in a drunken frolic, on the anterior part of the
left parietal bone, with his own sword, which was a straight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
heavy one, and a wound about two inches long was made
in the side of his head through the bone. His little finger
was cut at the same time, and it was not until the finger had
been dressed that I was asked to look at the head, which he
declared had nothing the matter with it. He was vomited,
and purged, and the next morning bled, and as symptoms of
inflammation of the membranes of the brain came on or increased,
the bleedings were repeated, the quantity taken at
each time being gradually diminished. He lost 250 ounces
of blood in five days, after which he gradually although
slowly recovered, some small spiculæ of bone coming away
during the cure. Returning to England, the vessel was taken
off the Scilly Islands, and he was sent to Verdun, where he
remained several years, until liberated by the peace of 1814,
when he rejoined his regiment, which had served in the Peninsula,
and had returned to North America. It was soon
found that he became outrageous on drinking a very little
wine, and was odd in his manner, and had a great propensity
to set out walking for hours without apparently knowing
what he was about, or where he was going. When his
regiment came immediately in front of the enemy, he was
found going over to their lines, without being aware of what
he was doing; and he was at last obliged to be sent to England,
having evidently become deranged. This gentleman
has ever since been confined in a private mad-house. His
brother offered to allow the bone to be removed; but after
thirty years of derangement a recovery could not be expected,
and it was declined. If the examination I have since learned
to be proper in such cases, had been made at the time, the
inner table of the bone would have been found broken and
depressed; and he might now have been in health both of
mind and body.</p>

<p>I removed, in Lisbon, in the hospital appropriated to the
wounded French prisoners in 1812, a portion of bone by the
trephine, which had been fractured by a sword some months
before: the wound had not healed, and some pieces of bone
were depressed. One piece, in particular, of the inner
table, was sticking in and irritating the dura mater, and was
in all probability the immediate cause of the fits from which
the patient had been suffering. He recovered.</p>

<p>A British soldier received a wound at the affair of El Boden,
in front of Ciudad Rodrigo, from a sword, on the top
of the head; he accompanied me to Alfaiates, on the retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of the army. The bone was apparently only cut through,
yet the inner table was depressed, and felt rugged when examined
with the probe. The symptoms of inflammation
increasing on the fourth day, and not being relieved by
copious bleeding, I removed a central portion of the cut
bone by one large crown of the trephine, and took away several
small pieces which were sticking into the dura mater,
after which all the symptoms gradually subsided.</p>

<p>266. The whole of the French wounded, who remained on
the ground or were taken prisoners after the battle of Salamanca,
were under my care, and among them there were several
severely wounded by sword-cuts received in the charges
of heavy cavalry made by Generals Le Merchant and Bock.
The cerebellum was laid bare in two cases without any immediate
bad effect. In one particular case, which recovered,
(after the battle of Waterloo,) the brain was seen pulsating
for several weeks; and the statements made to me by the
different officers at Brussels and Antwerp, and afterward at
Yarmouth and Colchester, entirely confirmed the observations
I had made, and the recommendations I have inculcated
on this particular point as resulting from the practice of the
Peninsular war.</p>

<p>267. It would appear that too much stress is laid upon a
difference which is supposed to exist in the danger of trephining
a man on the first or on the seventh day after an
accident; and that an error may be committed in believing
that the trephine is a more dangerous instrument on the first
day than on the seventh. The question is not whether the
man is to be trephined or not, but which will be the best
and safest day or time to do the operation. I do not hesitate
to say the first, believing the violence to be greater
when done on parts already in a state of inflammation, than
when they are sound. When the inner table has pierced the
membranes and gone into the brain itself, the individual will
in most cases ultimately die miserably of the accident if not
relieved by art. It is less safe to let him designedly run the
certain risk of cerebral irritation, which when once excited is
often indomitable, than to remove the cause, and endeavor
to prevent the evil. If the cerebral irritation only manifested
its effects on the surface of the dura mater by causing suppuration
there, delay might be admitted; but as it usually gives
rise under these circumstances to the formation of matter on
the surface, and even in the substance of the brain, where it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
is deadly, “la chirurgie expectante” cannot be allowed.
Lastly, there is not more danger of a hernia cerebri, as has
been supposed, when the operation is done early, than when
it is done at a later period; on the contrary, the patient has
a much better chance of escape from hernia cerebri, and from
all other evil, when the local and the general treatment are
decided and efficient.</p>

<p>If, on attempting to remove a fragment buried in the brain,
serious convulsive movements should be excited, it would be
proper to desist from all further attempts to extract the
splinters until the brain has become more quiescent.</p>

<p>It is necessary to recollect that the brain appears to be
insensible, or nearly so, when first exposed; and it has rarely
occurred that a serious convulsion or anything beyond vomiting
has taken place on the removal of a piece of bone from
the brain; nor will any difficulty be found in removing such
small fragments as can be seen with a pair of forceps duly
adapted for the purpose. It is impossible to say at what
period of time the brain may become irritable, and no longer
admit of its being touched without convulsive movements
ensuing; but when this state of irritation has commenced,
and its existence is proclaimed by the excitement which
takes place on touching the fragment of bone, the surgeon
should at once desist from all attempts to remove the foreign
body. The brain under ordinary circumstances is much
more likely to recover from an injury, all foreign or irritating
matters having been removed, than when suffering from
their presence.</p>

<p>268. The establishment of the principles which ought to
regulate the practice of surgery in cases of fracture with
depression of the inner table of the skull, is of the greatest
importance. The principle being laid down that it is right
and proper to examine all such wounds with a blunt, flat
probe, in order to ascertain if possible whether the inner
table be depressed and broken, the question necessarily arises,
what is to be done when such depression and breaking down
of the inner table have been ascertained to have taken
place? There can be no hesitation in answering, that in all
such cases the trephine should be applied, although no symptoms
should exist, with the view of anticipating them. The
old doctrine, it may be said, in regard to fractures generally,
is revived in these cases, but on a principle with which our
predecessors were not sufficiently acquainted. A patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
very often survives a mere depression of the skull; he may,
and occasionally does survive, a greater depression of the
inner than of the outer table; but it has not been shown
that he ever does survive and remain in tolerable health,
after a depression with fracture of the inner table, when portions
of it have been driven into the dura mater. If cases
could be advanced of complete recovery after such injuries,
they would not supersede the practice recommended, unless
they were so numerous as to establish the fact that injuries
of the dura mater and brain by pieces of bone sticking in
them are curable without an operation, and without leaving
any serious defects. There are great objections to the trephine
being applied in ordinary cases of fracture, not attended
by symptoms of further mischief; but the nature of the cases
particularly referred to having been ascertained, the practice
should be prompt and decisive in every instance in which the
surgeon is satisfied that there is not merely a slight depression
or separation of the inner table, but that several points
of it have been driven into the dura mater. If one trephine
will suffice, the central point being applied close to
the edge of the middle of the wound in the bone, it
should be applied there; but if the cut be longer, and the
spiculæ of bone extend upward and downward in its length,
a small trephine should be applied as near each end as may
be judged advisable, and one edge of the cut bone should be
removed by the straight saw, of which Paré and Scultetus
made such use in ancient times, and which Mr. Hey of Leeds
revived in modern surgery; or the small straight saw may
be used alone, if the object of removing a portion of bone
can be attained without the trephine. By these means sufficient
room will be obtained to remove the broken pieces of
bone which are irritating the dura mater and brain. The
danger resulting from the application of the trephine, in
such cases, bears no proportion to the risk incurred by leaving
the broken portions of bone as a constant cause of irritation.</p>

<p>269. There is an essential difference between a depression
of the skull in a <span class="allsmcap">CHILD</span> and in an <span class="allsmcap">ADULT</span>. In the child the
inner table is not brittle&mdash;it bends equally and does not
break; it very often does little mischief when depressed,
and gradually recovers its level. The brain in young persons
is softer and less consistent, and can accommodate itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
more readily to pressure for a limited time, without ultimate
mischief, than the brain of an adult; so that a continuance
of the most urgent symptoms can alone authorize the application
of the trephine in children, and in young persons
under fifteen or sixteen years of age. A similar bending of
the long bones in young children is often observed at an
early period in life.</p>

<p>270. The propriety of dividing the scalp in an adult, in
order to examine the state of the bone beneath, when evidently
depressed, thus rendering a simple although comminuted
fracture a compound one, is a matter of very great
importance, the decision of which rests upon the still more
essential point&mdash;viz., whether a depressed portion of bone
ought or ought not to be removed? This again must depend
upon the nature and extent of the depression, for
many persons who have suffered from such a misfortune
have recovered without the depressed portion being raised.
It is a question of degree or extent, upon which every surgeon
must form a judgment from his own observation and
experience.</p>

<p>The difference between a simple and a compound fracture
of the leg is often considerable; it is more often dependent
on degree. When the fracture is nearly transverse, and the
skin is cleanly divided, the difference between it and a simple
fracture of the same part is little more than one of time.
This may be the case with an injury of the head; the difference
between the two states in fractures of the skull has,
however, been much exaggerated; so much so, that no reliance
can be placed on the supposition that there is more
real danger in a case of fracture with depression in which
the scalp has been divided, than when it has been only
bruised, and not divided. I admit that theoretically it
ought to be otherwise, but theory and practice do not always
correspond. In all cases in which a fracture with <i>marked</i>
depression is known to have occurred in an <span class="allsmcap">ADULT</span>, it is good
practice to ascertain the nature and extent of the depression.
It is imperatively necessary if accompanied by symptoms of
compression.</p>

<p>If the result of a great number of comparative trials
should be in favor of never, under any circumstances, raising
a depressed portion of bone in an adult, but of leaving
it to the efforts of nature, an incision in order to ascertain
the state of parts below ought not to be made; but as such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
a result is not likely to be obtained, the practice recommended
appears to be the best.</p>

<p>The scalp should be divided, in such cases as may require
the operation, by a straight, crucial, or such other shaped
incision as may be found most convenient to the surgeon;
but no part should be removed which can be preserved with
the hope of maintaining its life.</p>

<p>271. The cranium, together with the fracture and depression,
being exposed, the question whether the trephine
should be applied or not is next to be determined. If the
operation by the trephine, or that of sawing a piece of bone
out of the head, were not in itself dangerous, there could be
no hesitation about its use; but it is a dangerous operation,
especially in crowded hospitals, and ought not to be resorted
to when it can be avoided. If any ten healthy persons were
trephined in a hospital, one would in all probability die from
the effects of the operation, and three or four more might
have a narrow escape from the inflammation of the brain
and its membranes, or the other consequences which would
probably ensue. It is not the admission of air, which has
been even lately supposed to do mischief, that is to be
dreaded in these cases, but the same kind of irritation which
often follows the abstraction of a piece of bone under other
and more ordinary circumstances at a later period of time.</p>

<p>The following cases are illustrative of many important
points:&mdash;</p>

<p>William Rogers, aged nineteen, of the 32d Regiment, was
wounded on the 16th of June by a musket-ball, which entered
at the inferior angle of the left parietal bone, knocked
him down, and for a few minutes rendered him insensible.
On recovering his mental powers, he found that he was
unable to speak, not so much (as he said afterward) from
the want of power to form words, as from the incapacity of
giving them sound. He was conscious of everything passing
around him, and reasoned correctly. He retired out of
the reach of shot, and then lay down for the night. On the
following morning, he went to Brussels, where he was examined
and dressed. On the morning of the 18th he reached
Antwerp on horseback, very giddy, and overwhelmed with
fatigue, fasting, and watching; he was admitted into the
Minimes General Hospital and put to bed, when he soon fell
into a sound sleep, which with some tea refreshed him much.</p>

<p>June 19th. The ball was found to have passed obliquely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
upward and backward at least two inches, and could be distinctly
felt with a probe. It gave more the idea of having
raised the outer table than that of having depressed the
inner. The defect in speech was in some measure diminished,
and this with giddiness were the only symptoms of
compression. A poultice was placed over the wound, a
brisk purgative given, and spoon diet ordered.</p>

<p>20th. The pain and giddiness having increased, with
annoyance from noise and exposure to light, twenty-six
ounces of blood were taken from the arm. The following
day the purgative was repeated, and the patient was much
relieved. Everything went on well, the wound was nearly
healed, and he was considered almost fit to be discharged,
when, on the 16th of July, the wound began to open; on
the 18th it was dilated and a portion of the cranium removed
by the forceps; this was soon followed by symptoms
of inflammation of the brain; twenty ounces of blood were
taken immediately from the arm, purgatives and diaphoretics
were ordered, and the strictest abstinence enjoined. 23d.
Venesection was repeated, as well as the other means usually
adopted to reduce high action. 24th. Completely relieved.
26th. Another portion of the cranium removed, the dura
mater being fully exposed; the general health in the best
state.</p>

<p>August 3d. Doing remarkably well; the wound healthy;
the pulsation of the brain evident; the power of speech perfectly
restored. The ball yet remains in, according to the
opinion of the patient, (who is a fine, intelligent lad,) and
he thinks it has gradually descended toward the petrous
portion of the left temporal bone. Sent to England at the
end of the month, the wound being healed.</p>

<p>When I saw this man at Antwerp I gave my opinion,
without hesitation, that the bone and the ball ought to
have been removed in the first instance, when he would have
had a better chance for perfect recovery. The operation,
when afterward performed for the removal of the loose pieces
of bone, placed his life in great jeopardy. He was discharged
the service with the ball lodged, and it is more than
probable that he did not long survive, which he might have
done if the ball had been removed when it was first felt
within the skull.</p>

<p>In the following case the ball could not perhaps have
been removed in the first instance with propriety; it might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
however, have been lying on the dura mater, or near it,
within reach, and the actual state of things ought to have
been ascertained, the surgeon afterward deciding whether
any further operation were necessary.</p>

<p>Thomas O’Brien, 28th Regiment, aged twenty-three, was
wounded by a musket-ball on the 16th of June at Quatre
Bras; the bullet penetrated the occipital bone below and to
the right of the junction of the lambdoidal and sagittal
sutures. On his arrival at Colchester, the wound was
healthy in appearance and healing rapidly. It appeared
from his own account that for some hours after the injury
he was totally deprived of sight; since that time he has
been constantly more or less affected with headaches, for
which he has been prescribed occasional cathartics and low
diet. He has also been affected with pain and weakness
in both eyes, but more particularly in the right. While at
Brussels, and during his progress to Ostend, he lived very
irregularly, and was frequently intoxicated. The external
wound was entirely healed on the 20th of July, and no suspicion
existed that the ball was lodged in the brain. On
the 25th matter was perceived under the scalp, and was
evacuated yesterday. To-day, the 27th, he complains of
increase of headache; pulse small and quick. V. S. ad ℥vj.
Haust. cathart. statim. 28th. In the course of this day
his symptoms have become very urgent; he is restless, with
a very quick pulse; an extensive crucial incision was made
in the site of the original wound, and now for the first time
it was discovered that the ball had penetrated the brain;
several loose pieces of bone were extracted; a considerable
quantity of arterial blood was suffered to flow from the small
vessels divided in the incision. His bowels had been well
opened by the cathartic. The most vigorous treatment was
continued, but the symptoms notwithstanding increased, and
he died on the morning of the 29th of July.</p>

<p>The ball was found lodged nearly two inches deep in the
substance of the right posterior lobe of the brain; a considerable
quantity of pus surrounded it; some inflammation
of the brain and its membranes was observed, but much less
than might have been expected.</p>

<p>A. Clutterbuck, 61st Regiment, aged twenty-five, was
wounded in the back of the head by a musket-ball at the
battle of Toulouse, on the 10th of April, 1814. He felt
little inconvenience from the wound during the first two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
days. On the 14th he complained of severe pain in the
head, giddiness, and dimness of sight; the face was flushed,
pulse hard and frequent. Twenty ounces of blood were
taken from the arm, and the wound enlarged so as to expose
the cranium. The upper part of the os occipitis was
found fractured by the ball, and a circular portion of it,
about the size of a shilling, was depressed and fractured.
15th. Pain in the head much abated; no giddiness, dimness
of sight, or any unfavorable symptom; pulse still hard.
V. S. ad ℥xx. To be well purged. 19th. He was bled
again this day to the extent of twelve ounces, as a matter of
precaution. 23d. Continues free from any bad symptom.
May 8th. The wound is now much contracted, and he feels
no inconvenience. A small portion of the bone still feels
bare to the probe, but the greater portion of the depressed
piece is covered with healthy granulations. No exfoliation
has taken place. May 24th. The wound is nearly healed;
he is in good health and spirits, and without inconvenience.</p>

<p>This case may be properly contrasted with that of O’Brien,
as showing by the result the difference between an uninjured
and an injured brain. If the fractured and depressed bone
had not been at the back part of the head, it is probable the
depressed portion would have been removed in the first instance,
as it certainly would have been after the 15th, if the
unfavorable symptoms had not yielded to the general treatment;
but the bone would then have been removed under
much more unfavorable circumstances than at first.</p>

<p>The following case is related to show the extent to which
blood-letting may frequently be carried to preserve life.
There having been no reason to believe that the symptoms
depended on fractured and depressed bone, the scalp was
not divided; and as the symptoms were coeval with and not
consecutive to the injury, they were therefore supposed to
depend on concussion rather than on compression of the
brain. If the trephine had been applied on the fourth day
because the insensibility continued, the additional injury
would in all probability have proved fatal. If the depletion
of all kinds had been less effective, the inflammation of the
brain or of its membranes would certainly have terminated
in the effusion of lymph or the formation of matter, which
the use of the trephine would not have prevented nor
removed.</p>

<p>George Mills, an artillery driver, aged twenty-eight, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
admitted into the Dépôt de Mendicité Hospital, Toulouse,
May 29, 1814, in consequence of having been thrown from
his horse on his head against the ground. He had fallen on
the right side of the os frontis, immediately above the eye,
where the surface of the skin appeared to be scratched and
bruised, but the bone was not depressed: he was bled freely,
but remained insensible. The next morning he was again
bled to twenty ounces, which operation was repeated in the
evening. On the 29th, the temporal artery was opened,
and a vein in his arm at the same time, the breathing being
strong and sonorous, the eyes closely shut, and he lying
quite insensible; the pulse before the bleeding was quick
and small; after he had lost about eight ounces of arterial
and eight ounces of venous blood, it became fuller, and the
breathing was somewhat relieved; the slightest touch gave
him pain, and he shrunk from pressure made directly above
the eye. The temporal artery was again opened in the
evening, and ten ounces of blood were taken away. A purgative
and a stimulating enema were ordered, and cold was
constantly applied to the head.</p>

<p>30th. He has been freely purged and appears more collected;
the pulse is still quick and small; breathing very
free; the irritability continues and he complains of pain on
pressing the head. The purgative and the enema were repeated,
and ten ounces of blood were drawn from the temporal
artery, after which he attempted to speak. 31st.
Passed a good night; the pulse is quick and small; pain in
the head still great; was again bled to twelve ounces, and the
purgative was repeated. June 1st. Pulse quick; there is
not so much pain in the injured part, and he appears more
sensible; was bled to twenty-four ounces, and the purgative
was repeated. 3d. Was again bled to ten ounces. From
this time until the 20th, he gradually improved, and was then
discharged cured.</p>

<p>The treatment in these cases was the same, although in
one there was no fracture, and in the other two there was
fracture with depression. The broken portions of bone did
not, in Clutterbuck, appear to press unequally on the dura
mater, and it was presumed that the moderate degree of
pressure which ensued from the depression might be borne
with impunity, as it did not seem likely to be accompanied
by the projection inward of any pointed pieces which might
irritate the brain. The result confirmed the supposition and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
justified the treatment. If the examination of the depressed
part had led to the apprehension that such points of bone
did exist, and were sticking into and irritating the dura
mater or brain, they would have been removed, in the belief
that although they might not at the moment have given rise
to any other symptoms than those which depended on the
blow, the time would come when they would scarcely fail to
cause those which usually accompany the formation of matter
within the skull. If this danger should also be avoided,
the subsequent evils which have been noticed as occurring
at a later period, and which ultimately require the same operation
for the relief of the patient after months of acute suffering,
might be encountered; for although a person may
temporarily recover from an injury in which a portion of
bone has been allowed to remain a source of irritation to
the brain, it does not follow that such recovery should be
permanent. If there be a doubt on the mind of the surgeon,
whether there be or be not any pieces of bone depressed and
irritating the brain or its membranes, he should wait; this
is the real difference between the surgery of the latter part
of the Peninsular war and that of the olden time.</p>

<p>272. When a fracture is accompanied by depression, and
the broken portion or portions of bone would seem to be
driven into the dura mater or the brain, or to press so unequally
upon them that as much mischief is likely to ensue
from leaving as from removing them, especially in an adult
or a middle-aged man, less harm will in general follow from
ascertaining the fact by dividing the scalp and removing the
broken pieces than by doing nothing, more particularly when
the presence of a foreign body has been ascertained. If
there be no symptoms indicative of mischief below the fractured
part, the surgeon must then decide, after the best estimate
he is able to make, of the probable evil which will
occur from allowing the broken or depressed portions of
bone to remain.</p>

<p>A French grenadier was brought to the field hospital the
second day after the battle of Salamanca; he had received
a blow on the left side of the head, probably from a piece of
shell, which had caused a contusion and swelling on the left
parietal bone, with a graze of the scalp, but without any
opening communicating with the bone. This swelling, on
examination, was so soft, and the feeling of depressed bone
beneath so distinct, combined with the fact of the continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
lethargic state of the patient, that an incision was made into
it, when the bone beneath was found broken into several
small pieces. On clearing away the blood, two pieces which
were loose were readily raised and removed by the elevator
and forceps, and egress given to an ounce or two of blood,
which were extravasated beneath, apparently from the rupture
of the vessels passing between the dura mater and the
bone. The patient regained his senses in the course of the
night and morning of the third day, and under a strictly
antiphlogistic regimen gradually recovered, some other small
pieces of bone coming away, one or two others apparently
reuniting to the uninjured parts, showing that it is not
always necessary to remove every portion of bone which
may be broken, provided any bond of union remains, and
principally that which exists between it and the dura mater.</p>

<p>These different cases stand out in bold relief as eminently
successful and opposed to those said to have been equally so
under <i>la chirurgie expectante</i>. They tend to show that
however good a general rule may be, it may admit of many
and important exceptions; and they prove that experience,
aided by sound and correct observation, is essentially necessary
for the formation of a scientific surgeon.</p>

<p>273. In young persons the brain will bear a greater degree
of pressure and of irritation with impunity than it will in
persons of mature age. By far the greater number of cases
in which recovery has taken place after fracture and depression
of the skull with injury of the brain, and even loss of its
substance, have occurred in children or in persons <i>under the
adult age</i>; greater reliance may therefore be placed on the
powers of nature in them; and recourse may be had less
frequently to the aid of operative surgery in order to prevent
mischief than in older persons, even when the bone is
fractured as well as depressed. It will be found, and the
remark is important, that the cases of fracture and depression
reported to have been successfully treated without operation,
have occurred principally in young persons.</p>

<p>The result of my experience has rendered it imperative to
remove at once all portions of bone or foreign substances
which have materially injured the dura mater in adults,
although no symptoms of compression should be observed.
If the wound in the dura mater should not be sufficiently
large to allow the offending body to be extracted through it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the opening must be enlarged to enable it to be withdrawn
without further laceration.</p>

<p>274. Depressed portions of bone, accompanied by fracture
at the <i>back</i> part of the head, need not necessarily be removed
in the first instance. When the fractured and depressed bone
is accompanied by symptoms of compression in an adult,
which continue after the usual antiphlogistic means and
remedies have been employed in vain, and appear to increase
rather than to diminish, the broken and depressed portion
should be raised; for although the brain will bear and
accommodate itself to pressure in many persons in a manner
which could not be either foreseen or expected, it will not do
so in all; and the removal of the bone offers the best chance
for relief, whether the mischief has arisen from the pressure
made by it or occurs from the extravasation of blood beneath.
When the principal symptom of compression is a
severe fixed pain in the part, although the state of the fracture
and depression would not alone have rendered the removal
of the bone positively necessary, it is advisable to do
so when this symptom is present.</p>

<p>The greatest discrimination is required in cases where the
extent of the injury is not so manifest and in which there is
more room for doubt. In most cases in which a slight or
moderate degree of fracture and depression of the skull has
taken place, the symptoms of concussion are present as well
as those of compression. The symptoms of concussion are,
however, coeval with the injury, and although those of compression
may take place almost instantaneously, they more
usually occur at a later period of time. The symptoms of
concussion may nevertheless continue for days, more particularly
the insensibility, or that state which is approaching to
it, complicating the case and embarrassing the practitioner.
In a child or young person the symptoms of compression or
irritation, when they appear even at a secondary period,
may pass away under further moderate depletion; but in an
adult any undue delay in giving the necessary relief, by the
removal of the depressed portion of bone, will in general be
destructive to the patient. It is the irritation caused by the
depressed bone on the dura mater, and communicated to the
brain, which gives rise to the unfavorable symptoms and to
the formation of matter which follows them.</p>

<p>A gentleman received a blow on the side of the head,
which knocked him down and deprived him of his senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
from which state he partially recovered, and vomited; some
stupefaction, however, remained, although he could be made
to answer by a little importunity. Pulse 62, irregular, breathing
slow, the pupils contracting under the influence of light;
the integuments where the blow was received were soft and
swollen, in all probability from an extravasation of blood
beneath. The next day the pulse was full and regular, the
pupils were dilated, vomiting had taken place several times,
and the patient answered correctly on being sharply questioned.
He was bled largely, purgatives were administered,
and cold was steadily applied to the head. He was bled the
next day; on the third the left arm became paralytic, the
pupils continued dilated, and on the fifth day paralysis implicated
the left leg as well as the arm. There could now
be no doubt that the brain was suffering from compression;
but as the nerves of the excito-motory system were unaffected,
and the functions of ingestion and egestion were satisfactorily
accomplished, it was thought advisable to trust to
the efforts of nature. The swelling of the scalp was painful.</p>

<p>A week afterward the general symptoms were the same,
or only slightly augmented by fever; but, as the swelling of
the scalp was more painful, it was opened, and a quantity
of matter was evacuated, the bone beneath being fractured
and depressed. As this operation gave some relief, it was
thought advisable to wait, with the hope that the benefit
thus obtained might prove permanent. The patient did not
improve, however; and as the symptoms of fever increased,
and were accompanied at last by rigors and great pain in
the head, the depressed portions of bone were removed, and
about half an ounce of purulent matter escaped from between
the dura mater and the bone. The relief given this time
was effective, and the patient perfectly recovered. “La
chirurgie expectante” placed this man’s life in the greatest
jeopardy. It was only saved at the last moment by the aid
of that surgery which ought not to have been withheld when
the paralysis, by affecting the leg as well as the arm, demonstrated
the extension of the mischief within the head. In
this instance the operation was successful, but it is not in
general so serviceable when delayed to so late a period. It
is in cases of this serious nature often a means of prevention
rather than of cure.</p>

<p>275. When a severe blow, accompanied by a shock, as
from a fall, has been received on the head, and the skull is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
so thick and strong as to be able to resist the violence thus
offered without being broken, or is only slightly fractured,
the vibration or <i>trémoussement</i> is directly communicated to
the brain, giving rise to laceration or bruising of its structure
in various situations, to the rupture and separation of
the vessels of the dura mater from the bone to which they
are attached, and to derangement of other parts, which will
in all probability be followed by inflammation, and may even
terminate in the formation of matter under the dura mater
as well as above it, and even in the brain itself. It is said
to take place by “contre-coup” when the mischief occurs in
any other part of the head than that which is struck, numerous
instances of which are given by the older French
authors. They were probably cases of laceration, the consequence
of concussion of the brain, and not relievable by
the art of surgery; but the injury which the older surgeons
particularly distinguished as by “contre-coup” was where
the blow was on one side, and a fracture took place or matter
was formed in a circumscribed spot on the other; these
cases did sometimes, they say, although rarely, admit of relief
by operative surgery. These cases, unaccompanied by
fracture, do not appear to take place under the improved
method of treatment by larger depletion, by antimony, and
by the early use of mercury. In the event, however, of their
occurring, there is no surgeon of the present day who would
attempt an operation of exploration on the opposite side of
the head to the injury, without some sign of mischief existing
at that part; although such operation, if done, might
accidentally be followed by success.</p>

<p class="h2sub">TUMORS OF THE SCALP, ETC.</p>

<p>276. When the periosteum covering the bone is bruised,
or the bone is merely deprived of this membrane, it does not
follow that it should die or exfoliate. In many instances
the wound will gradually close up and heal, as if no such
accident had happened. A blow or bruise on the head often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
gives rise to a swelling or tumor, from the rupture of the
small vessels passing into the cellular membrane between the
scalp and the pericranium; the tumor in these cases appears
<i>immediately</i> after the receipt of the injury as a soft swelling,
and is usually found to contain blood, which in most
instances is removed by absorption in the course of from two
to three weeks. In some cases inflammation supervenes,
and one part becomes tender and appears to point; into this
a small incision should be made to allow the blood and matter
to escape, when gentle compression should be resorted
to in order to induce the parts to unite. Swellings of this
kind in new-born infants, occurring from pressure during
delivery, may be readily mistaken for deficiencies of the occipital
and parietal bones, if it were not for the absence of
all motion, which under such circumstances would be communicated
to them from the brain. The blood effused in
the cellular membrane raises the border of the swelling,
which becomes harder than the neighboring parts, while the
center remains soft and yielding, giving a sensation to the
finger as if the bone beneath were wanting, or, after a blow,
the idea that the bone beneath is depressed. If such a
swelling be unnecessarily opened, considerable inflammation
and suppuration will often follow, to the great inconvenience
of the patient; this will in general be avoided by the use of
a moderately stimulating cold lotion.</p>

<p>277. In other cases of tumors, which are called secondary
in contradistinction to the preceding, the patients go on well
for eight, nine, or more days, at the end of which time they
complain of headache, giddiness, nausea, restlessness, thirst,
and generally of fever. A few days more, frequently from
the thirteenth to the fifteenth day, rigors, sometimes severe,
are superadded, and a swelling, if not observed before, is
now perceived on the spot where the injury had been received,
if the integuments have not been divided; or, if
there be a wound, it loses its healthy red appearance, and
assumes a yellowish, unhealthy color, which is accompanied
by a thinner and more acrid discharge. From this time the
symptoms gradually increase, the patients become delirious,
convulsed, comatose, and die; and matter is found between
the skull and the dura mater, or in or on the substance of
the brain. If this secondary swelling be divided, and the
fluid evacuated, which is not good pus, the pericranium will
be found detached and the bone bare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
It has been stated that a bone so circumstanced would not
be found to bleed on being scraped, and that, by attending
to the want of hemorrhage from the outside of the cranium,
the extent of the evil might be ascertained, and that so long
as a denuded, discolored bone will bleed on being scraped, it
may be considered that the dura mater is attached below,
and that no operation should be performed.</p>

<p>The essential difference between the primary and the secondary
swellings is to be found in the fact that, although
the bone be exposed, and even in some degree may have
changed its color in the primary swelling when matter has
formed, the febrile symptoms will subside after its evacuation,
healthy granulations will spring up, and little or no exfoliation
will take place. In the secondary swelling none of
these favorable symptoms or appearances will take place, for
the bone is incapable of maintaining its life, and must die.
If the outer table only be implicated, it may exfoliate; but
if there be reason to believe that matter has collected beneath,
on the dura mater, the bone should be removed by
the trephine.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the dura mater proceeding to suppuration,
or the formation of matter between it and the bone,
appears to have been a much more common consequence of
injuries of the head in former times than at present. It is
not now of frequent occurrence in London hospitals.</p>

<p>As blows on the head and the structure and functions of
the brain are the same at present as formerly, the difference
in regard to such cases can only depend on the difference of
treatment. It is, in fact, infinitely more depletory now, and
therefore less operative. Blood is taken away in larger
quantities, although to this there are exceptions, depending
on the constitution of the patient, which will not always
admit of it, while the potassio-tartrate of antimony and
mercury are by most surgeons administered at an early
period.</p>

<p>Suppuration, or the formation of pus on the surface of
the dura mater, not being, under the strictly antiphlogistic
and mercurial system, so common as formerly, sufficient attention
has not perhaps been paid to another evil which frequently
accompanied it in former times, viz., suppuration on
the surface and in the substance of the brain itself; for the
greater number of those who died with fracture and depression
of the skull, and whose cases are recorded, suffered also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
from alteration of the structure or substance of the brain, and
the formation of matter within it or upon its surface. This
termination might not have taken place in a large proportion
of the cases in which it occurred if the depressed bone
had been raised to its level, and the irritation arising from
undue or unequal pressure had been avoided. It must be
admitted, however, that an internal part of the brain may
receive such a shock at the moment of injury, as well as an
external part, that no treatment can arrest the progress of
the mischief, although it may be delayed; and when the
patient dies, after four, five, or more weeks of alternate hope
and suffering, matter may be found in some part of the brain
where an injury was not suspected.</p>

<p>Purulent matter may be formed beneath the dura mater
in a confined spot, or it may be diffused generally over the
surface of the brain, in which case the sufferer has no chance
of relief.</p>

<p>278. The operation of incising the dura mater, to admit
of the discharge of blood or matter from beneath, and even
of puncturing the brain, has not been much resorted to in
England; this may be an error. The records of surgery
supply many cases where it might have been done with advantage,
and some in which it was done with the greatest
benefit to the patient. It is not an operation which ought
to be performed without signs sufficiently demonstrative of
the necessity for doing it.</p>

<p>I have seen, on the removal of a portion of bone by the
trephine, the dura mater rise up rapidly into the opening so
as to attain the level of the surface of the skull, totally devoid,
however, of that pulsatory motion which usually marks
its healthy state. An opening into it, under these circumstances,
has allowed a quantity of blood or of purulent matter
to escape, proving that the unnatural elevation of the
dura mater was caused by the resiliency of the brain when
the opposing pressure of the cranium was removed. This
tense elevation, its abnormal color, and the absence of pulsation
are positive signs of there being a fluid beneath, requiring
an incision into the dura mater for its evacuation.
It is a point scarcely noticed in English surgery&mdash;one which
was not in the slightest degree understood at the commencement
of the war in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>A. Monro, of the 42d Regiment, was wounded on the 10th
of April, at Toulouse, by a musket-ball, which fractured the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
left parietal bone slightly, without depressing any part of it.
No symptoms followed requiring more than ordinary attention
until the 23d, up to which time he had been kept on
low diet, for the most part in bed, and had been bled and
purged. On the evening of that day he became feverish,
and hasty and odd in manner, and the pulse quickened; he
declared himself, however, to be quite well, and submitted to
be bled and physicked with great reluctance, calomel combined
with opium being given him at short intervals. On
the 24th he complained of pain in the head, which he said
was very slight, and that upon the whole he was quite well,
and would not be bled nor have anything done. He was
bled largely by force, which lowered the strength of the
pulse, but did not relieve any of the symptoms of irritation
of the brain. On the 25th he was evidently worse, although
he declared himself to be quite well; he talked a little incoherently;
the pupils were dilated; the pulse quick but
regular; the countenance was changed; he was sensible,
apparently, upon all points except that of being much worse,
which he resolutely denied, saying he was better and would
soon be well. Satisfied that matter was forming, or had
formed, in or on his brain, I desired that the trephine might
be applied on the fractured part and the bone removed.
This, however, he would not permit the officers in charge to
do, and they awaited my return in the afternoon, when, finding
him much worse, I directed it to be done by force, three
of his own regiment with others attending to assist the surgeons.
He called upon these men by name not to allow him
to be murdered in cold blood, declared he was getting well,
and would get well if let alone, and prayed them to avenge
his death on the doctors if they meddled with him. The
surgeons were dismayed, and requested that the operation,
which they said required great care, should be performed by
me, their chief. I therefore removed the bone; and the
moment it was taken away the dura mater rose up in the
opening to the level of the surrounding bone, and remained
without any pulsatory motion. I had no doubt of matter
being beneath, and that, from his general state, the man
would die. I did not therefore think it prudent, under all
the circumstances, to do more than warn his comrades that,
when dead, they would see the whole brain beneath in a state
of suppuration. He died that night; and the next day they
saw the whole of the left hemisphere soft, yellow, and cov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>ered
with matter, to their great surprise and satisfaction at
the accuracy of the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Absalom Lorimer, of the 42d Regiment, was wounded by
a musket-ball on the 10th of April, 1814, at the battle of
Toulouse, which carried away a small portion of the scalp
just above the right temple, fracturing the bone slightly, but
without any depression. No symptoms occurred demanding
more than ordinary attention for the first fortnight, during
which period he had been bled once, purged, and kept
on low diet. On the 25th, he complained of pain in his
head around the wound, shooting to the back part; pulse
60; pupils dilated. An incision having been made to the
bone, the pericranium was found detached, and the bone
fractured, but without any obvious depression. V. S. ad ℥xx,
calomel and colocynth: as the pain continued, the bleeding
was repeated in the evening. 26th. Pain in the head greatly
relieved; pulse 60; bowels torpid. Ten ounces of blood
were taken from the temporal artery, and the calomel and
colocynth, salts and senna were repeated. On the morning
of the 29th, the symptoms of compression having increased,
the trephine was had recourse to, and the fractured portion
of bone was removed: a layer of coagulated blood was found
on the dura mater, which puffed up into the opening. In
the evening he became convulsed, the pulse intermitted, and
he died. On examination, a large abscess was found in the
right hemisphere of the brain, having the ventricle for its
base, with some matter on the surface of the brain, and between
the dura mater and the bone at the base of the
cranium.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day that I performed this operation,
I had done another of the same kind at the Hôpital
des Minimes; the dura mater rose up in a similar manner
without pulsation into the opening made by the removal of
the circular piece of bone by the trephine; on puncturing
it a considerable quantity of pus oozed out. The opening
was enlarged; and the flow of matter was daily encouraged,
until it gradually diminished, and ceased with the formation
of granulations, and the drawing in and cicatrization of the
part.</p>

<p>279. It has been supposed theoretically that a wound
through the dura mater was particularly dangerous, in consequence
of the tunica arachnoides which lines it being a
serous membrane; and that, if the inflammation which en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>sued
did not cease at the adhesive stage, by the consolidation
of the surface which covered the pia mater with that
which lined the dura mater, a diffuse inflammation would
necessarily follow, which might spread over its whole extent.
This has not been found practically to be the case; and if a
simple wound of the dura mater be a danger that ought to
be avoided, the risk run cannot be put in comparison with
that which accompanies the continuous irritation depending
on the presence of a spicula of bone, which has passed
through the dura mater, and is irritating the brain beneath.
It has also been supposed theoretically that the danger
would be diminished if the pia mater were wounded also,
as the brain would project and fill the wound; but the accuracy
of this opinion may be doubted. If the dura mater
were injured through error or design, I should not think the
evil lessened by adding to it a wound of the pia mater, and
perhaps also of the brain.</p>

<p>By those who have been accustomed to the terrible injuries
which occur in military warfare, in which large portions
of the brain are sometimes exposed, and even lost,
without much inconvenience following, the exposure of or
the opening into the dura mater is not considered of so
much importance as it is by those who have had fewer
opportunities of seeing such awful cases; while the formation
and retention of matter below the bones of the cranium
is, on the other hand, more dreaded by those who have often
seen their ill effects than by those who have not had many
occasions for observing them; by whom, however, they are
often considered, when they do take place, to be irremediable
by art.</p>

<p>280. Gunshot wounds of the skull are attended by certain
peculiarities. In ordinary circumstances there is usually an
external wound and a fracture more or less comminuted, with
depression; this wound will almost always require to be enlarged
by a simple incision, so as to show the extent of the
depression or the size of the broken and depressed portions
of bone. When the bone is scarcely injured, and the periosteum
is only bruised, or when the bone is even deprived
of this covering, it does not follow that it should die or
even exfoliate. In many instances the wound will gradually
close in and heal, as if no such evil had occurred; and in
those which do not terminate so favorably, the cure may
only be delayed by the exfoliation of a layer or scale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
bone from its outer surface, unless the mischief should have
implicated the parts beneath.</p>

<p>A musket-ball striking directly against a bone sometimes
makes a hole not larger than itself, with or without any
radiating fracture; and one large trephine, if properly applied,
will often embrace the whole of the mischief, and
admit of the removal of the broken pieces. As a center-pin
cannot be used, the trephine may be made to turn very
well in most cases in a flat but thick bar of iron, having a
hole in the middle, of such a size only as will allow the polished
outside of the trephine to turn in it. Sufficient support for
the instrument will be obtained by this means until it has
made a groove in the bone for itself, when the operation may
be continued as it would be in an ordinary case after the
removal of the center-pin.</p>

<p>When a musket-ball ranges along the side or top of the
head, it may break the outer, and depress and fracture the
inner table to a considerable extent, for the space even of
three or more inches. The broken portions of bone may in
general be removed by means of good forceps and a straight
saw; and no good reason can be given for delaying the
operation unless the nature of the injury be doubtful, when
it may be as well to wait for symptoms. It sometimes happens,
although rarely, that a ball sticks so firmly in the bone
that it cannot be extracted by working round it in any ordinary
way with a pointed instrument. The difficulty usually
arises from the ball having half buried itself in the diploe,
so little of it being exposed as not to admit of a firm hold
being taken of it. The large trephine, used in the way
pointed out, has several times overcome this difficulty. The
removal of the outer table has been sufficient where the inner
one has not been driven into the dura mater; when any
doubt is entertained on this point both should be removed.</p>

<p>281. A ball or other foreign substance may penetrate the
brain directly or obliquely. When the ball penetrates the
brain directly, it is not often that it can be removed, and
the sufferer very rarely survives beyond a few days, even if
the ball has been extracted; more particularly if the injury
have occurred in the anterior part of the substance of the
brain; several persons, however, have recovered, in whom
the injury occurred toward the back part of the head, the
ball being allowed to remain. It will be better in all such
cases to allow the ball to remain, which it will often do for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
many days, until circumstances render it necessary to endeavor
to find it. When it can be felt immediately under
the surface of the brain, it ought to be removed like any
other foreign substance.</p>

<p>Dr. Rogers relates the history of an excellent case, in
which a young man aged nineteen received a wound on the
frontal bone, just above the center of the left superciliary
ridge, from the bursting of a gun on the 10th of July. It
was not until the 4th of August that he discovered a piece
of iron lodged within the head, in the bottom of the wound,
(from which a considerable quantity of brain had come
away,) which he extracted the next day. It proved to be
the breech-pin of the gun, three inches in length, and three
ounces in weight. By the tenth of December his patient
was perfectly cured.</p>

<p>When a ball strikes the head obliquely, it may enter and
pass out or lodge. Nearly all these cases die, but one occasionally
escapes, and none should be allowed to die without
assistance. When the entrance and exit of the ball are
obvious, and not far distant from each other, the splinters
of bone should be removed; and if the little bridge between
the openings should be injured, the whole should be taken
away by the straight saw; an operation which cannot, however,
be necessary in the first instance, if the portion of bone
be apparently sound.</p>

<p>At the battle of Talavera, a soldier of the 48th Regiment
was brought to me in a state of insensibility; he had received
a musket-ball on the upper part of the right side of
the frontal bone, where it had entered, and had evidently
passed backward; it could be followed by the probe rubbing
against the bone for nearly four inches. The scalp over
this point was soft, as if blood were effused below; and on
dividing it, a fracture was seen bulging rather outward. The
trephine was applied forthwith, and the bone removed, together
with the ball, which only wanted a little more impetus
to have come through. The brain was injured, and the man
died two days afterward.</p>

<p>A French grenadier was wounded at the battle of Salamanca
by a musket-ball, which struck him on the right side
of the head, penetrated the temporal muscle, and lodged in
the bone beneath, giving rise to symptoms of compression.
On dividing the parts, I found that the ball had fractured
and driven in a part of the temporal bone, one portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the ball being above, and the other below the broken bone.
The upper half of the ball was readily removed, but several
small portions of bone were raised by the elevator and forceps
before the remaining portion of the ball could be drawn
from under the bone, which was not depressed, the ball having
been cut in two by its edge. The dura mater was bruised,
but not torn through. The wound suppurated freely; several
pieces of bone exfoliated, and the patient was ultimately
discharged in progress toward a cure.</p>

<p>A small ball sometimes becomes so flattened by striking
against the skull as to remain undiscovered when care is not
taken in the examination. A soldier was wounded at the
storming of San Sebastian by a ball on the side of the head,
which was supposed not to have lodged. The wound did
not heal, a small opening remaining, although no exfoliation
took place, and the bone did not seem to be bare. On dividing
the scalp to ascertain the cause of the delay in healing,
a small ball, quite flat, was found; it had sunk down a little
below the hole left for the discharge to which by its irritation
it had given rise.</p>

<p>When a larger ball or a piece of a shell strikes the head,
the fracture is usually extensive, and portions of bone, or a
piece of the shell itself, are often lodged in the substance of
the brain. There is nothing peculiar in the management of
these cases, which are for the most part unfortunate.</p>

<p>282. A suture may be separated by a musket-ball, which
impinges with a moderate degree of force directly upon it,
but not without great danger. It can, however, only happen
in young persons in whom the sutures are not obliterated
as they are in elderly ones; in general it takes place
when the ball happens to lodge as it were between the bones
concerned in the formation of the suture. The first case of
the kind which came under my observation occurred at the
taking of Oporto. I met with a second at Albuhera, a
third at Salamanca, and a fourth in a slighter degree at
Orthez.</p>

<p>A heavy dragoon was wounded at the battle of Salamanca
by a musket-ball in the body, which caused him to fall from
his horse, injuring the top of his head. Little attention
was paid to him until mischief was suspected from the
lethargic state into which he fell, which could only be attributed
to the blow on the head, where a tumor was observable.
This, on being divided, showed a separation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
edges of the sagittal suture, from which some blood flowed.
Two crowns of the trephine were applied on the twelfth
day, in order to admit of the free discharge of some blood
which had been extravasated from a wound in the longitudinal
sinus, after which the symptoms subsided, and the
patient gradually recovered.</p>

<p>A ball may pass apparently through the fore part of the
head from side to side without doing much mischief beyond
depriving the sufferer of sight. It does not in these cases
injure the brain, but passes immediately below it and through
the back part of both orbits. In four such cases the recovery
was rapid, but the blindness was irremediable.</p>

<p>283. The danger of injury to the frontal sinuses has been
greatly exaggerated, and vanishes in a great degree when
attention is paid to their structure. The uncertainty of the
depth of the cavity between the tables of the bone, and the
irregularity of the exposed surface of the inner table, which
may through carelessness be mistaken for depression, should
be remembered.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 29th Regiment was wounded at the battle
of Talavera by a ball, which struck him on the lower part
of the right side of the forehead, fracturing the external wall
of the frontal sinus. On examination, the ball could be
felt lodged in the sinus, whence it was readily removed by
enlarging the opening, and the man recovered without any
bad symptoms.</p>

<p>At the storming of Badajos, a soldier of one of the regiments
engaged at the little breach was struck by a small
ball about the size of a swan-shot; it penetrated the frontal
sinus of the right side, and stuck in the inner table, the outer
being considerably injured and splintered by the blow. The
splinters having been removed, the small ball could be seen
sticking in the inner table of the bone, whence it was easily
extracted, leaving the dura mater bare beneath. He was
sent to Elvas, and recovered with a good and firm cicatrix.</p>

<p>After a wound of the frontal sinus has healed, the air has
been known to raise up the integuments of the forehead into
an elastic crepitating swelling whenever the patient blew his
nose, so that a compress and bandage on the part were
required for its relief; but these cases are very rare.</p>

<p>284. Wounds of the bony parts within the orbit are often
attended by the most serious consequences. A boy, nine
years of age, was struck by his playfellow with the end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
thick iron wire on the right eye, which blackened it. There
was no external wound; but as there was some bloody chemosis
at the upper part and the inside, there was a probability
of the wire having penetrated deeply, although the opening
could not be discovered by the probe. The accident had
happened two days before, but he did not think himself ill.
He was well purged, and cold water was applied externally.
Two days after, he complained of sickness, headache, and
some pain over the brow. He was bled freely from the
temple of that side by leeches, and well purged by calomel
and jalap. On the sixth day his mother reported him as
having been delirious and restless all night. He was found
stupefied, answering with difficulty and incoherently; pulse
very quick, skin hot and dry, with some convulsive twitches
of the face and arms; pupils slightly obeying the influence
of a strong light, but not dilated. He was again bled freely
from the temple, but his breathing became more difficult, he
fell into a comatose state, and died in the night. On examining
the head, the stiff iron wire was found to have passed
under the upper eyelid, between it and the eye, through the
posterior part of the orbitar plate of the frontal bone and
into the anterior lobe of the brain, which was softened at
that part, and bedewed with matter.</p>

<p>A woman, who had been struck by her husband on the
left eye with a tobacco-pipe, while preparing her frying-pan
for cooking, knocked him down with the pan, and ruptured
his right eye, which was lost. She then pulled out a piece
of the pipe which was sticking in the orbit, between the lid
and upper and inside of her own eye, which was uninjured.
She complained of little but the bruise, and rather brought
her husband than herself for advice. Bled and purged, she
did not complain of anything for several days, when she said
she had been very ill all night, with nausea, headache, and
shivering; with hot and dry skin, pulse very quick, the
upper eyelid paralytic; she looked very ill, became delirious
at night, and died two days after the first complaint of
serious illness. On examination, half an inch of the red
waxed end of the tobacco-pipe was found to have gone
through the sphenoid bone, by the side of the sella turcica,
and to have lodged in the brain, whence it was removed
bedewed with pus, the brain being yellow and softened
around it.</p>

<p>A wound of the longitudinal or lateral sinuses, allowing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
free discharge of the blood poured out, is of comparatively
little consequence. It is, on the contrary, a very fatal injury
when the blood is permitted to accumulate.</p>

<p>285. A protrusion of the brain, often improperly called
a fungus cerebri, is of two kinds, and occurs at different
periods of time. The first kind is principally composed
of coagulated blood, usually appears immediately after, or
within two days after, the injury, and is generally fatal. The
second takes place at a later period, although it has occurred
on the third or fourth day, and is formed for the most part
of brain. These protrusions rarely take place when a considerable
portion of the skull has been lost or removed, the
brain then being able to expand to such an extent as the inflammatory
impulse from within may render necessary. When
the opening is small, and the dura mater has not been injured,
it has seldom been observed. It is then principally when the
opening in the skull has been of greater extent than the size
of one piece of bone removed by the trephine, the dura mater
having yielded either in consequence of the injury or by
ulceration, that this evil takes place; it is not, under proper
treatment, a fatal, although it is always an extremely dangerous
occurrence.</p>

<p>In the first kind of protrusion, the dura mater must necessarily
be torn to some extent, and the tumor which comes
through it is of a dark-brown color, glazed and covered in
general by the pia mater. These protrusions were accompanied,
in every case I have seen, by delirium and other
symptoms of inflammation of the brain and of its membranes,
and not by coma, until near the fatal termination of the disease.
I have seen them torn off by the patients themselves
during life, or before death; and satisfied myself that they
all arose from hemorrhage into the substance of the brain,
probably immediately below its surface, which became more
elevated as the inflammation proceeded, and was gradually
protruded at the part where there was the least opposition.
When the tumor was torn off, little hemorrhage ensued, but
a dark-brown blood cavity was seen in the substance of the
brain; and when cut off and examined, the protruded part
seemed to be covered by the pia mater, with or without a
layer of cerebral matter, and was made up generally of
coagulated blood. No case of this kind recovered.</p>

<p>In the second kind of protrusion, or that which usually
although not necessarily takes place when the first or active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
inflammatory symptoms are on the decline, the tumor is formed
of the substance of the brain. It has been supposed that in
whatever manner a case of hernia cerebri may arrive at a
favorable termination, there must inevitably be a loss of brain
proportionate to the extent of the protrusion&mdash;a conclusion
which the experience of the Peninsular war did not confirm,
while it may lead to the establishment of an erroneous practice
for the too early removal of the protrusion. The loss
of a portion of one of the hemispheres of the brain is now
known to occasion little or no inconvenience in many instances,
either to the intellectual or corporeal faculties;
nevertheless, as the precise quantity of brain which a person
may lose with impunity has not been ascertained, it may be
as well not to deprive a patient of any, provided its removal
can be dispensed with; and that it may be so dispensed with,
the practice of that war gave positive proof in several instances,
by the protruded part being gradually withdrawn
within the skull, the wound having afterward healed by the
ordinary processes of nature.</p>

<p>There were three cases of recovery from a protrusion of
the brain after the battle of Toulouse.</p>

<p>Bernard Duffy, 40th Regiment, aged twenty-four, was
wounded on the 10th of April, and admitted into the
Caserne de Calvete Hospital, on the 13th, with fracture and
depression of the upper part of the os frontis. Some portions
of detached bone were removed; he was largely bled
and purged.</p>

<p>On the 14th, he complained of severe pain in the head,
giddiness, dimness of sight, and drowsiness. The pupils
were much dilated; pulse 60, and full. An incision was
made down to the bone, and the divided arteries were
allowed to bleed freely. One perforation was made by the
trephine, and the whole of the detached and depressed
pieces of bone, which were of considerable size, were removed,
one of them having penetrated the dura mater.&mdash;15th.
Has less pain in the head; pulse full and slow; pupils
dilated, with a tendency to coma, but he is sensible when
spoken to. V. S. ad ℥xxiv. Continue the purgatives.&mdash;18th.
Is less drowsy; pupils more contracted. The surface of the
dura mater is sloughy, and a small, dark-colored excrescence
is rising up through the opening in the cranium.&mdash;22d. The
fungus cerebri has considerably increased in size during the
last few days; in other respects he is doing well.&mdash;24th.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
The wound looks clean; the discharge is healthy. The
fungus increases in size, and is rather above the edges of
the wound; some sloughs have separated from it, and it has
now a red and tolerably clean appearance.&mdash;26th. The
wound granulates regularly; the excrescence seems to enlarge
rather at the base than at the upper part; it was
touched slightly with lunar caustic without any pain or unpleasant
symptom being produced.&mdash;30th. Continues doing
well. The pupils are still somewhat dilated, but contract
readily on the admission of light; appetite good; bowels
regular; and the patient says he has no complaint. Discharge
from the wound healthy; the fungus is prevented
from increasing by a slight application of the argenti nitras
every second day. He has not required any medicine for
some time past.&mdash;May 6th. The wound has closed around
the fungus, which is a little above its edges; it is touched
slightly every day with lunar caustic or the sulphate of
copper. The pulsation of the brain elevating and depressing
the fungus is perfectly distinct; no constitutional derangement.
Was discharged cured to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>William Donaldson was admitted, on the 13th of April,
1814, into the Dépôt de Mendicité Hospital, having received
a gunshot wound in the head on the 10th of April, which fractured
the right parietal bone to a considerable extent. The
brain protrudes; pulse quick and small; bowels open. V. S.
ad ℥xvi.&mdash;14th. The pulsation of the brain is evident, and
the protrusion increases; he complains of no particular pain;
the discharge is profuse, and of a thin, black, watery quality;
pulse 90; bowels freely open. V. S. ad ℥xvi. Continue the
purgatives.&mdash;15th. The pulse and bowels natural, the protrusion
has scarcely increased; discharge profuse, and still
gleety; a small compress was laid over the dressings, and a
bandage was lightly applied.&mdash;16th. Pulse and secretions
natural; the wound looks more healthy; the discharge something
better in appearance; the fungus does not increase.&mdash;19th.
Is doing well, and does not complain of pain; functions
natural; the protrusion somewhat less; discharge
good. A small quantity of cloth has come away.&mdash;21st.
Discharge improved. Continue the purgatives.&mdash;26th. The
protrusion evidently diminishes, and begins to heal at the
edges.&mdash;30th. The hernia cerebri has considerably diminished;
secretions natural; a small quantity of bone has come
away; discharge diminished.&mdash;May 4th. The wound is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
healing rapidly; the patient is now permitted to get out of
bed, and has half diet. Another very small piece of bone
has come away.&mdash;10th. The wound is now nearly healed.&mdash;Between
the 15th and the 25th several small pieces of bone
came away.&mdash;On the 26th, on introducing the probe, a small
piece of bone followed it; and on further examination a
large piece was felt quite loose, and was removed by incision.
Discharged cured to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Gentle pressure was made on the protrusions, according
to the feelings of the individuals, in both these cases; when
made too firmly, it gave rise to swimmings and pain in the
head, retardation of the pulse, a sense of sickness and fainting,
and on one occasion to syncope. Pressure could only
be borne when very lightly applied while the protrusion was
increasing, but could be gradually augmented when it became
stationary, and during its diminution and secession.
The pressure was continued until after the wound had
healed.</p>

<p>I had occasion, at Santander, to remove a portion of
bone, including the upper part of the lambdoidal suture of
the right side, from the head of a soldier of the Light Division,
in consequence of symptoms of irritation having come
on after an irregularity in drinking. He had been wounded
by a musket-ball on the heights of Vera, which had fractured
and depressed the skull at that part some weeks before.
A piece of bone was depressed, and had irritated the dura
mater at the part; the membrane had some matter upon its
surface, and was evidently abraded. The operation gave
relief, but a tumor soon sprang up, evidently composed of
brain. The patient was again bled, purged, and starved;
calomel and opium were given in moderate doses, and the
protrusion ceased to increase; about the same time it changed
color, became yellow, fetid, softer, and soon wasted away,
pieces of dead matter separating at each dressing, until it
sunk within the level of the skull; after which healthy
granulations sprung up, and the wound healed.</p>

<p>In the fatal cases, paralysis, accompanied by stupor and
other symptoms of compression of the brain, invariably
supervened before death.</p>

<p>The preceding cases prove that persons may recover after
having had a protrusion of the brain, without as well as
with the loss of a portion of its substance, the difference in
all probability between the cases being dependent on the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>gree
of mischief which gave rise to them. In the fatal cases
I have seen, the protrusion was manifestly a part of the substance
of the brain, and firmer than the hemisphere beneath,
which was soft, pulpy, and of a yellow and sometimes of a
reddish color, the lateral ventricle being filled with a sero-purulent
matter, pus being also spread over the surface and
intermingled with the pulpy structure, into which the brain
had been changed. The protrusion was the consequence of
low inflammation of the brain; and greater caution had been
necessary during the progress of the mischief than had been
enforced. It was the observation of this, and of other circumstances
not less important, which led me to enjoin that
rigid system of management insisted upon in all cases of injury
of the head. There can be no doubt that the formation
of many of these protrusions was aided by the opening made
in the dura mater, which would have restrained their growth
if it had been sound. The dura mater therefore should
never be opened if it can be avoided.</p>

<p>It has been proposed to destroy protrusions of the brain
with escharotics, and by ligature; and more faith has sometimes
been placed in the knife for their early removal than
in the more deferred operations of nature. Greater reliance
may, however, be placed on the efforts of nature, assisted by
a methodical treatment of the low inflammatory state of the
brain, and by such pressure at a later period as can be borne
with comfort, and persisted in with propriety.</p>

<p>286. It has been supposed that abscess of the liver followed
injuries of the head in a more peculiar manner than
injuries of other parts of the body, an opinion upon which
too much reliance should not be placed; for experience has
induced me to think that unless the liver be really injured
by a fall or blow, it only becomes affected in a secondary
manner, in a similar way to the lungs or other viscera, or to
the joints or other parts. The new disease in these cases is
always insidious in its nature and progress, and for the most
part fatal in its result, as has been explained at length,
(Aph. 59, p. 62, et seq.)</p>

<p>287. When a person has received a serious blow on the
head, which has given rise to an exfoliation of the bone, or
to a very slight depression of the skull, he is rarely restored
to his previous healthy and natural state. The scalp adheres
firmly to the bone beneath, instead of sliding loosely
over it, and a deep hollow is formed, which would imply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
that greater mischief had been done and a greater loss of
bone had been sustained than had actually occurred. This
is the more remarkable when pieces of bone have been
removed. Major D., of the Indian army, was wounded on
the left side of the forehead, at its upper part, by a musket-ball,
at the assault of Maheidpoor. Several pieces of bone
were removed, and the pulsation of the brain was evident
under the discharge. The point of a little finger passes
into the hole left by the cicatrization of the wound, to a
greater extent than might be expected. This officer suffers
from headaches, augmented or brought on by any exertion
of body or mind. He cannot bear exposure to the heat of
the sun. He can scarcely drink three glasses of wine without
feeling their effect. Persons so afflicted can bear no
great exertion of any kind. They fall down under exposure
to heat. They are easily inebriated, rendered furious by a
small quantity of liquor, and often become stupefied, comatose,
or even die suddenly. In addition to these evils, which
may be avoided by care, many are subjected to fits, which
are apparently epileptic; and others suffer from such intolerable
pain in the part injured, as well as in the head
generally, as to be desirous of seeking relief by an operation,
even at the risk of life.</p>

<p>These injuries are often accompanied during their progress
by mental defects which time does not always remove.
The memory is very often much impaired; it is frequently
defective as to things as well as to persons. The sight of
one or of both eyes may be impaired, or even lost. Ptosis,
or a falling of the upper lid, is not an uncommon although
a more curable defect. Speech is not only difficult, but the
power of uttering certain words is often lost; a language
is occasionally for a time forgotten, and a sort of conventional
one has even been adopted, under my own observation.
The more serious evils which befall these unfortunate
sufferers are aberrations of mind, rendering some degree of
restraint necessary, or a state of fatuity, which is not less
distressing. These intellectual defects are often accompanied
by various states of lameness or debility, from which there is
but little hope of recovery. Pathologists have supposed that
concussion of the brain is frequently accompanied by, and
may indeed be essentially dependent on, small extravasations
of blood in various parts of or throughout the brain, not
larger than the point or head of a small pin, constituting, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
fact, a derangement which, when general, is destructive of
life, and, when partial, may sometimes be the cause of the
various defects which follow injuries of the head.</p>

<p>288. It is an interesting fact that a person who has been
shot in the head, or has fallen from the top of a house, so
as to become insensible, has no knowledge of the circumstance;
and when, after several days or weeks, he regains
his senses, he has no recollection of the injury, or of having
received the wound; or if he should have fallen from a
height, he only remembers that he was aware he was about
to fall, but of the actual descent, or of the injury, he knows
nothing.</p>

<p>289. The trephine, which is worked by turning the hand,
and makes therefore only a half turn, necessarily saws
unequally; but the operator has the advantage of being
able to press with it on any particular part as the sawing of
the bone draws to a close, and can thus cut any portion of
the bone which is thicker than the rest without wounding
the dura mater. The division and yielding of the last layer
of bone is very sensibly felt by the hand, and when sawing,
the surgeon can use the trephine as a slight lever with great
effect, by pressing on a particular part, or from side to side,
and the inner layer of the vitreous table may be in this
manner as much broken as sawn through. The piece to be
removed should never be brought away in the crown of the
trephine, but should be raised by the forceps and lever;
whenever a rough edge of the inner table remains, it should
be carefully rounded off with the lenticular or blunt-ended
instrument commonly used for that purpose.</p>

<p>290. Whenever there has been a loss of the integuments
or scalp, so that this part cannot be brought over the opening
made by the removal of the bone, some fine soft cotton
should be laid on the dura mater, so that a slight degree of
support may be given to that membrane, more particularly
when it is thought that it may not be necessary to examine
it for two or three days. When circumstances appear to
render a daily inspection necessary, the cut portions of the
scalp should be brought over the opening, and retained by
a slight compress and bandage kept constantly wet and cold.
The dura mater usually changes color and becomes more
red; a layer of lymph is seen adhering to it, from which
granulations arise and spring up until they touch the scalp,
to which they unite, or cicatrization takes place. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
patient dies early from other causes, and the calvarium has
been raised, the discolored spot on the dura mater marks
the place from over which the bone was removed. I have
seen this in a state of slough, and the only apparent discoverable
mark of disease.</p>

<p>One of the improvements in modern surgery is to be found
in the restriction which has gradually been placed on the
repeated use of the trephine on the same person, and on the
removal of large portions of the skull. Cases are not, however,
wanting in the older authors which would appear to
justify the proceeding, although it may perhaps be said that
they only show how great an extent of injury may sometimes
be committed with impunity.</p>

<p>Saviard trepanned one person twenty times. Russ Martel
and Le Gendre, surgeons to the King of Navarre, say that
in the year 1686 they took away nearly both parietal bones,
and the patient recovered and lived for thirty years afterward,
half his body, however, being paralyzed. Marechal
applied the trephine twelve times successfully, Gooch thirteen
times, Desportes twelve times. Saviard says that he had
under his care a woman whose parietal bones, together with
a great part of the occipital and frontal, separated at the
end of two years after a blow; the bones thus separated
resembled a calvarium sawn off a dead person. No fungus
or hernia took place, and she lived for several years afterward.</p>

<p>Dr. Drummond, deputy inspector-general of hospitals,
has published the case of a seaman belonging to H.M.S.
“Mutine,” who in 1845 fell down some stone steps at Sierra
Leone, receiving a contused wound on the scalp, for which
he was admitted into the Royal Naval Hospital at Plymouth
in October of the same year. The bone, which was
not supposed to have been injured, was then found to be
denuded of its pericranium to some extent, (left side of occipital.)
After an attack of erysipelas, followed by numerous
purulent deposits under the scalp, necrosis went on rapidly;
there was oozing of pus from beneath the diseased bones,
and gaping of the coronal and sagittal sutures, the brain
pulsating very distinctly in the spaces. In July, 1846, he
was removed to Melville Naval Hospital at Chatham.
During the six years he has been under observation, there
have been repeated attacks of erysipelas, followed by profuse
suppuration. Both tables of the bones have suffered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
some places; in others only the external. About five
square inches have been lost from the right side of the
frontal, right parietal, and squamous part of the right
temporal. The whole of the occipital to within a short
space of the foramen magnum is deficient, with the exception
of about two inches in the center of the bone, which
are now undergoing the process of separation. On the left
side, Dr. Drummond adds, there has been less destruction
of the bones, but extensive caries was going on there, and
fetid pus was being discharged from several openings at the
date when the case was reported, (April, 1851.) At no
point was there any tendency to reproduction of bone, or
arrest of the disease.</p>

<p>291. The removal of a large portion of the skull may be
necessary where the broken portions are deprived of their
natural support and connections, but as little should be taken
away as possible. When the loss of sense and motion is
accompanied by fracture, and continues to increase rather
than to diminish, after the necessary and usual means have
been adopted for its relief, a piece of bone should be removed.
If blood should be found in any quantity on the dura mater,
it may be necessary to take away more bone to admit of its
free discharge; for although the gradual pressure of the
brain from within will tend to expel it, this object may not
be attained in sufficient time, and the patient may be lost.
The older surgeons in these cases were anxious to ascertain
how far or to what extent the dura mater was separated from
the skull, and they often removed large portions of bone accordingly;
although their practice should not be implicitly
followed, repeated observation has shown that modern surgeons
have often fallen too much into the opposite extreme
of doing nothing. When blood has been evacuated in this
manner, the parts must pass from a state of inflammation
into that of suppuration before the dura mater can again
adhere to the superincumbent bone, and care must be taken
that the matter shall have a free discharge. If symptoms
of fever, followed by those of commencing compression,
should supervene from the granulations arising from the dura
mater filling up the opening and preventing its exit, they
should be excised; or if the matter should have gravitated
in a direction which does not admit of its being discharged,
the opening in the skull should be increased so as to remove
the impediment, and thereby lessen the danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
A layer of blood is often extravasated very thinly over the
whole surface of the brain and cannot be removed, although
it may be absorbed. It is, on the other hand, often collected
in larger quantity on the basis of the cranium, whence it will
not be absorbed and cannot be removed. It may be extravasated
without reference to the part on which the blow has
been received, giving rise in the end to symptoms of epilepsy
or apoplexy, for the relief of which no surgical operation
can avail; but when a blow has been undoubtedly received
on a part of the skull, and any sign of mischief can be perceived
on or in that part, the removal of the bone is permissible.</p>

<p>292. The wind of a cannon-ball has been supposed to exert
some influence on the brain when passing close to the head;
there is, however, no valid foundation for the opinion. An
officer of the fifth division was struck by a cannon-shot,
during the assault of Badajos, on the right side of the head
and face. It carried away the right eye and the whole face,
the left eye hanging in the orbit, the floor of which was destroyed.
A part of the lower jaw remained on the left side,
but a great part of the tongue was gone. He had lost a
large quantity of blood, but was quite sensible. In the
middle of the next day he suffered much from the want of
water to moisten his throat, which could not be procured.
After a distressing delay of three or four hours under a hot
sun, a small quantity was obtained, the arrival of which he
observed; and while I was giving directions relative to its
distribution, I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder, and on turning
round saw this unfortunate man standing behind me, a
terrific object, holding out a small cup for water, not one
drop of which he could swallow. Alone among strangers,
he felt that every kindness in our power to offer was bestowed
upon him, and he contrived to write his thanks with a pencil,
which he gave me when he pressed my hand at parting at
eleven at night. I was glad at sunrise to find he had just
expired.</p>

<p>293. When a portion of bone is as it were sliced off with
the scalp and adheres to it firmly, the scalp and bone should
be reapplied; and the cure will often be effected without
difficulty. When the portion of bone cut off and hanging
to the scalp, which is turned down, has but little adherence,
it should be removed.</p>

<p>A German dragoon was brought to me in front of Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>drid,
who had received a slicing cut of this kind on the top
and side of the head, which caused a portion of the scalp and
parietal bone to be turned down over the ear, uncovering the
dura mater. Replaced and retained in its situation, the flap
and bone appeared to adhere, and the man recovered. In
the case of a Portuguese soldier cut down by the French
cavalry in a sortie during the second investment of Badajos,
a portion of bone cut off with a flap was quite loose, and was
removed. The patient did equally well.</p>

<p>In the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons there
are ten skulls which have suffered from very severe slicing
cuts. They appear to have been collected from the burial-place
of some establishment for invalid soldiers in Germany.
The portions of bone thus sliced, and they are large pieces,
were once detached, and afterward reunited a little out of
their proper places, so that the points of separation and of
union can be distinctly seen. These fissures are all in a certain
state of progress toward being filled up by bone, and
the patients must have lived some months, if not years, after
the receipt of their respective injuries; for bone is deposited
apparently with difficulty and most carefully in all such cases,
so as not to irritate the membranes of the brain. The opening
in the first instance is filled up by granulations, over
which a thin skin is formed; this afterward becomes firmer
and harder, being in some cases, where the trephine had been
used, a thin but strong membranous expansion extending
from one edge of bone to the other. In others it is thicker
and more solid, and in a few instances osseous matter is deposited
in its circumference, so as in part to fill up the opening,
the edges of the bony circle made by the trephine
becoming gradually thinner as they appear to grow inward.
It is common for an exfoliation to take place in such cases
from the edges of the cut bone, and from the circle made by
the trephine. It has been occasionally observed, after death,
that the circular cut edge of the bone does not become thin
in the manner described, but that a sort of ridge forms around
and within it.</p>

<p>When the scalp is torn down without being much bruised,
and a large flap extending from the occiput to the forehead
falls down on the shoulder, covered with blood or dirt, the
flap should be cleansed and restored to its place. When it
is large, two or three sutures may be necessary to keep it in
its proper situation. The flap may not entirely adhere under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
any management, but it will do so in parts; and care should
be taken to evacuate at an early period any matter which
may form by small but sufficient incisions made where required;
this will in general be above and about the ear.
When the flap is much bruised, the attempt at adhesion by
close apposition will be useless until after suppuration has
taken place, when a well-regulated pressure will do much
toward expediting the cure.</p>

<p>294. Erysipelas occurs in two forms: when the skin has
the ordinary redness characteristic of the complaint, and
when the color of the skin is not altered or is whiter than
natural, but puffed, tense, and shining, the inflammation being
seated beneath the tendinous expansion of the occipito-frontalis
muscle.</p>

<p>The general treatment should be regulated by the powers
of the patient and the state of the constitution, (Aph. 24,
page 39.) The local treatment of the first form essentially
depends on puncturing the red and inflamed skin all over
with the point of a lancet, assisting the flow of blood by
warm fomentations. The punctures should be repeated, if
necessary. The second form is to be treated by incisions,
perhaps the greatest improvement of the surgery of the
Peninsular war.</p>

<p>The scalp in such cases is in a state of general puffiness,
causing the head to look considerably larger than usual, but
without redness; it retains the impression of the finger.
Incisions are to be made in the scalp from two to four or six
inches in length, united by others, if necessary. The scalp
will often be upward of an inch in thickness, and filled with
a fluid partly serous, partly purulent. The small arteries
bleed freely, and should be allowed to do so as long as may
be desirable, when the hemorrhage should be arrested by
pressure. The head should be fomented. The essential
points are, to take off tension, and to allow the free discharge
of any fluid which may be secreted. The moment the parts
around a wound have become puffy, the surface of the wound
changing from a red to a yellowish color, with a thin discharge
instead of good pus, an incision should be made
through them, and repeated, if necessary. It relieves the
tension and the irritative fever, and prevents the delirium
which would follow; which neither bleeding, purging, nor
the other constitutional remedies which the state of fever
may indicate will remove. If it should be neglected, sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>puration
and sloughing will extend under the tendon of the
occipito-frontalis, or the fascia of the temporal muscle, and
the greatest danger will be incurred from this additional
cause.</p>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE CHEST.</p>

<p>295. Wounds penetrating the wall of the chest, and implicating
any part or portion of its cavity or contents, are
among the most dangerous of injuries. They require in their
treatment a more careful attention and a greater extent of
knowledge than most others which befall mankind. The
means which the improved methods of auscultation have
afforded cause the progress of the symptoms which follow to
be less obscure, and lead to a less doubtful practice than
formerly; while they render a knowledge of this branch of
medical science an essential part of the education of a surgeon.</p>

<p>296. <i>Incised</i> or <i>punctured wounds</i>, from swords, lances,
bayonets, or knives, require a treatment <i>essentially distinct</i>
on many points from that of <i>gunshot</i> wounds, especially in
the commencement. On this early treatment so much depends,
that details of the more serious or more important
cases are rarely found among the records of injuries sustained
on the field of battle, where so much is often to be done, and
so few are to be found to do it.</p>

<p>The simplest of the more serious results from injuries not
penetrating the chest is the occurrence of inflammation,
either of its lining membrane, giving rise to what is called
<i>pleuritis</i>, or of the substance of the lung, termed <i>pneumonia</i>,
or of both, constituting what has been named <i>pleuro-pneumonia</i>;
but many severe blows on the chest are not
followed by such serious consequences.</p>

<p>On the 17th August, 1808, in the act of leaving the village
of Colombeira to ascend the heights of Roliça, a soldier
was shot in the leg: he jumped up three or four feet,
and made a considerable outcry. A second was struck at
the same time by a ball on the shoulder, which did not penetrate,
but gave him great pain. A third received a ball on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
his buff-leather belt, on the right breast. The noise made
by these two blows was unmistakable. I saw this man fall,
and supposed he was killed: the ball, however, had only
gone through his belt, and made a mark on his chest, over
the cartilage of the fourth rib, the hardness and elasticity of
which had prevented further mischief. He recovered in a
short time, spat a little blood in the night, and after a large
bleeding was enabled to accompany me on the 20th to Vimiera,
ready for the fight next morning.</p>

<p>A soldier was struck on the hill of Talavera,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> on the
breast-plate by a ball, which, as he believed, had gone through
his body. He was as white as a sheet, and desperately
frightened. On opening his coat, I found the ball had indented
the breast-plate, and made a round, red mark on the
skin, without going deeper. I did not see him again for
several days, until after crossing the bridge of Arzobispo, on
the retreat to Truxillo. He was then engaged in disemboweling
a fine fat wild hog, among a herd of which we had,
unluckily for them, just fallen. He recognized me at once;
said that, as I told him, he had been more frightened than
hurt; that he had been bled largely and well physicked,
and after two or three days had thought no more of it. I
am bound to add that, in gratitude, he offered me a leg of
the pig, which, having nothing to eat, I could not but accept.
It supplied a dinner for three others who are now no more.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The Duke of Wellington received a blow from a spent ball at the
same time, near the left clavicle.</p>

</div>

<p>A soldier of the 40th Regiment slipped from the ladder
on which he was attempting to scale the wall near the great
breach of Badajos, and fell on his cartridge-box, which hurt
his left side so much as to render him unable to move for
some time. On the 8th of April he was much worse. The
part injured was painful to the touch; the difficulty of breathing
considerable; cough hard, with little expectoration; pulse
90, skin hot, appetite gone, tongue white. V. S. ad ℥xvj,

in quantity, and viscid. V. S. ad ℥xii; antimonials. 10th.
Pain still felt on coughing; expectoration reddish; difficulty
of breathing greater. Pil. cal. et antim. c. opio; V. S. ad

slightly sore) from what was manifestly an attack of pneumonia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
A gentleman, in 1835, fell from his shooting-pony on his
powder-horn, which bruised his right side from the seventh
to the last rib, and, as he said, knocked the breath out of
his body, and hurt him so much as to render him incapable
of walking from one room to another from pain in the side,
back, and thigh. No bones were broken. The pain, on the
second day, was augmented on breathing and on attempting
to cough. The third day he was purged, and blooded to
sixteen ounces, which gave some relief; but as the symptoms
increased on the fourth day, he was more carefully examined.
His right side could not bear pressure. The
respiratory murmur was distinct, but accompanied by a
crepitating rhonchus under the part injured. Cough troublesome;
expectoration mucous, viscid, and of a reddish tinge.
Antim. p. tart. and sulphas magnesiæ, every four hours. V.
S. ad ℥xiv. On the fifth day, the symptoms being little
altered, he was cupped on the part affected to fourteen
ounces. On the sixth, the pain was only felt on coughing,
or on drawing a very full breath; expectoration redder and
thicker; pulse quicker. The rhonchus was quite as distinct.
V. S. ad ℥xij, and the medicines to be continued.
After this he quickly recovered and the natural respiration
became distinct.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Cooke Tylden Patterson, of the Light Division,
was struck on the left breast by a musket-ball, on the morning
of the 15th of July, 1813, in front of the village of
Vera, in the Pyrenees. He fell on his back breathless, as
if he were killed. While waiting the order to advance, he
had been reading Gil Blas in Spanish, and on receiving it,
had hastily put the book in the breast pocket of his coat.
The ball had struck this, but, unable to penetrate it, had
fallen on the ground at his feet, completely flattened on one
side, and marked with the impression of the braid of his coat.
A piece of the cover of the book, about the size of a half-crown,
was driven in, and the leaves throughout were indented
by the ball. It was some days before the effects of
the blow entirely subsided.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 97th Regiment was struck at the unsuccessful
assault of Fort Christoval, opposite Badajos, by a
musket-ball, which went through his brass breast-plate and
coat, drove his shirt through the skin, and against the
sternum, which it was not able to penetrate. He fell, and
was supposed to be killed, but he soon recovered and ran to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
the rear. The ball was found flattened between his shirt and
coat. The part of the chest was very black next day, the
spot struck by the ball being much bruised. It was necessary
to bleed him largely. When the integuments are painful,
although merely bruised, the diluted tincture of arnica is a
useful application, and Scheele’s hydrocyanic acid, six drops
to an ounce of water, is said to be efficacious.</p>

<p>Major Lightfoot was struck by a musket-ball on the left
breast; it went through his clothes, the integuments and
the outer part of the great pectoral muscle, and slanted inward
for three inches toward the sternum, to which distance
its track could be followed. It was evident that the ball
had neither lodged nor penetrated, for no serious symptoms
ensued. In all probability it had been ejected the way it
went in by the elasticity of the cartilages of the ribs near
the sternum.</p>

<p>297. In order to understand, or to become in any way
acquainted with the changes from the natural structure which
are going on under derangement in the chest, even from
simple injuries, it is always necessary to have recourse to
auscultation, and sometimes, although more rarely, to percussion,
if the external parts are not too tender. Under all
circumstances both sides of the chest should be examined by
the stethoscope. As the ordinary breathing of an individual
is rarely sufficiently strong to enable the auscultator to hear
it with distinctness, the patient should be desired to inspire
fully and more quickly than usual, without much effort, and
without noise from the mouth or nose, or retaining his breath.
The inspiration and the expiration are both to be carefully
observed.</p>

<p>When the ear is firmly and equably applied to the chest
of a healthy young person, a very distinct and long-continued
sound is heard at the moment of inspiration, and another at
that of expiration. This is called the <i>vesicular</i> or <i>respiratory
murmur</i>, and is dependent on the air fully permeating
and distending the air-vesicles of the lungs. It has been
poetically compared to the sound of a gentle gale rustling in
a thick summer foliage&mdash;to the whisper of a retiring wave
on a sandy beach in a calm day. It is soft, scarcely sonorous,
equable, and during inspiration continuous. In childhood
it is louder than in adult persons, arising probably from
the greater activity of the lungs in young than in elderly
people. This is called, and especially when perceptible in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
adults, <i>puerile respiration</i>, as opposed to their ordinary, or
what in old persons may be called <i>senile</i>. It is more marked
during inspiration.</p>

<p>When the stethoscope is applied in the situation of the
great bronchial passages, as over the first bone of the sternum,
under the clavicle, in the center of or between the
shoulder-blades, a different sound is usually but not always
distinguishable, when the patient breathes fully, arising from
the passage of the air through these bronchial tubes. It is
compared to the noise made on blowing through a reed or
quill, and is called <i>bronchial or tubular respiration</i>. When
heard in other parts of the chest, it is a morbid sound. If
the stethoscope be applied over the trachea, the sound is
louder, rougher, and more intense, and is called <i>tracheal</i>
respiration. On listening over the trachea during speaking,
the voice sounds as if it were passing into the ear, and the
words are distinct&mdash;<i>tracheophony</i>. This, if heard in any
other part of the chest, is a sign of disease, for in the natural
state the voice is heard only to resound through the chest,
but the words are not heard if the other ear be stopped.
When heard, the sound has been called <i>pectoriloquy</i>, and is
supposed to imply the existence of a cavity at that part;
but the word is unnecessary, or, if used, it means that the
cavern or hollow communicating directly with the trachea
gives forth a similar or nearly similar sound, a <i>natural</i> sound
in an <i>unnatural</i> position. The essential difference between
<i>bronchophony</i> and <i>tracheophony</i> in the investigation of disease
is, that in the latter the voice apparently speaks through
the stethoscope into the ear of the auscultator, while in the
former it is heard with scarcely less distinctness, but at the
distal end of the instrument. Over the larynx it is louder,
hoarser, and rougher.</p>

<p>The length of the sound in inspiration, as compared with
that of expiration, has been said to be as five to two. One
is louder and longer than the other, a difference requiring
attention from the circumstance that morbid sounds of great
import are heard in inspiration, which do not prevail during
expiration. When any other difference is perceptible between
them, so that they more nearly resemble each other in duration
or in intensity, or when expiration is prolonged, some
structural alteration may be suspected in old persons, some
disease in young ones. When little or no respiratory murmur
can be heard after symptoms of inflammation have existed
for some time, the case is very serious, implying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
effusion into the cavity, or condensation of the lung, has
taken place to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>298. The number of inspirations in a minute in the adult
and elderly persons varies from eighteen to twenty-two in a
state of health: from twenty-two to twenty-six in children.
The stroke of the pulse is generally as four to one. If the
inspirations are eighteen, the pulse will in general be seventy-two.
Both may be slower, although they are often quicker
under disease. When the breathing is slower, it commonly
indicates some affection of the nervous system; when very
rapid, some important lesion within the chest.</p>

<p>The theory of percussion is founded upon three elementary
sounds, which are produced when a solid, a liquid, or a gaseous
body is struck; all others are varieties of these. The
sensation of resistance which is experienced at the same
time bears an exact relation to the density of these bodies&mdash;hence
the resistance when a solid substance is struck is
greater than when a gaseous one is under percussion. The
liver, the thorax in a case of pleuritic effusion, and the distended
stomach after a long fast, afford good examples of
these elementary sounds. To employ percussion successfully,
it is necessary that the strokes be uniform in force and
quickness, and that the finger or pleximeter be so applied
to the surface that no space exists between them, otherwise
such a sound will be elicited as may give rise to an incorrect
diagnosis.</p>

<p>It having been stated that a sound lung never fills the bag
of the pleura, particularly toward the diaphragm, at least
during ordinary respiration, I requested Mr. Quekett, the
Resident Conservator of the College of Surgeons, to ascertain
this by experiments on some sheep at the moment of
their being killed; and it appeared from them that the base
of the lung is always in contact with the surface of the diaphragm.</p>

<p>299. In ordinary expiration the chest diminishes in size.
The ribs which have been raised recede, by the elasticity of
their cartilages, and by the return of the ligaments, to their
state of rest; the elevated muscles become relaxed, while
others belonging to the lower part of the trunk and abdomen
contract. The diaphragm is relaxed, and pushed upward
by the viscera of the abdomen, pressed upon by the muscles
of its wall, if it should not be drawn upward by the attraction
of the lung, which when distended endeavors by its elas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>ticity
to return upon itself, and to occupy less space than the
capacity of the chest will afford. The lung, invested by an
elastic, special, and transparent membrane, and covered by
the pleura pulmonalis, is composed of an immense number of
air vesicles, the largest being equal in size to the fourth part
of a millet-seed. These air vesicles, crowded together, each
communicating with a fine bronchial tubule, are separated
from each other into groups by a condensed cellular tissue,
thicker where it surrounds these lobules, which alternately
form, when aggregated together, a lobe, whence it is called
interlobular tissue. An artery and vein form a very minute
net-work around each vesicle. These vesicles may become
filled with water; when dilated by air, they constitute what
is called emphysema of the lung. The lung in man is constantly
applied to the internal surface of the chest, the
pleura or serous membrane covering the lung being closely
applied to the pleura lining the wall, and one surface glides
upon the other, moistened by a secretion in just sufficient
quantity to effect this object. If the lower intercostal muscles
of a young animal be removed to a sufficient extent, the
lung and the diaphragm may be seen applied to the inside
of the pleura lining the rib, and <i>ascending</i> and <i>descending</i>
in concert, the lungs moving vertically, not horizontally. The
diaphragm ascending, covered by its pleura, is in a similar
manner applied to the lower part of the wall of the chest,
which had been filled by the lung during inspiration. After
death the lung remains closely applied to the pleura, recedes
on an opening being made into that membrane, and may collapse,
provided no adhesions exist to prevent it.</p>

<p>300. When inflammation of the pleura takes place, the
gliding motion is not effected silently, but with a peculiar
noise, called by the French <i>frottement</i>. When the lung is
inflamed, the respiratory murmur is changed in that part, or
is overcome by a peculiar sound, which can be distinctly investigated
by the ear&mdash;<i>rhonchus crepitans</i>. Hence the great
value of auscultation.</p>

<p>In the following observations it is not intended to give a
history of, or even the whole of the symptoms and consequences
of inflammation of the pleura and the lungs; but
only to draw attention to such of the principal facts as it
may be necessary to consider when these inflammations and
their consequences are caused by external injuries.</p>

<p>Acute idiopathic inflammation of the pleura usually com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>mences
by rigors, preceded perhaps by some signs of general
uneasiness, which soon become those of great febrile excitement.
Pain is early felt in the side in the course of the sixth,
seventh, and eighth ribs, or at the point corresponding generally
to the seat of the inflammation. It is usually sharp
and darting, is called a stitch, occupies rather a small space,
(the <i>point de côté</i> of the French,) and is always increased by
drawing a full breath or by coughing. The breathing is
short, from the disinclination to fill the chest, by which the
pain would be increased; it is hurried, and sometimes takes
place as if by jerks, from the necessity for its repetition, in
consequence of the smallness of the quantity of air admitted
at each attempt. When the attack is very severe the patient
tries to breathe with the healthy side only, the lower ribs of
the affected side being moved but slightly, and with evident
caution. If the inflammation have been caused by extreme
violence, pain will also be felt, particularly at the part
injured.</p>

<p>When inflammation has affected the pleura covering the
diaphragm, especially when caused by external violence, the
pain will be felt lower down, so as to lead to the suspicion
that it is also abdominal. When jaundice supervenes, it
occurs from the extension of disease through the substance
of the diaphragm, as is occasionally seen in wounds implicating
the chest, the diaphragm, and the liver.</p>

<p>A cough is not a constant accompaniment of the first stage
of disease; when present, it is usually dry, slight, infrequent,
and does not attract attention, unless accompanied by a thin,
frothy mucous expectoration, indicating the presence of bronchitis;
of pneumonia, if reddish. The patient usually lies
on his back while the pain is severe, and has a great indisposition
to turn fully on to the affected side. At a later period,
when effusion has taken place, the pain usually subsides, and
he turns on the side affected to relieve the difficulty of breathing,
caused by the pressure of the fluid on the sound lung
through the bulging of the mediastinum; but the manner of
lying, or <i>decubitus</i>, is of little importance, and should be subservient
to the feelings of the patient, who is sometimes comfortable
only when raised to nearly an erect position.</p>

<p>When the complaint is not subdued at an early period, an
effusion of serous fluid, more or less in quantity, takes place.
The whole cavity of the side affected has been known to be
filled in from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, giving rise to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
symptoms dependent on the degree to which the effusion has
taken place; <i>this</i> is the evil which in injuries penetrating
the cavity of the chest is most to be feared. When the external
wound has been closed, or is so partially closed as not
to allow the escape of the effused fluid, it is commonly the
immediate cause of the death of the patient. Its secretion
and early evacuation are therefore the most important points
to be attended to in wounds of the chest.</p>

<p>The respiratory murmur becomes less distinct as soon as
the pain prevents the ordinary distention of the affected side
of the chest, and diminishes the quantity of air which usually
penetrates the lung in any given time. As soon as a thin
layer of fluid commences to be thrown out between the
pleuræ, this murmur becomes fainter, and when it is complete,
it ceases. If the patient can bear percussion, the side
affected yields a dull, dead sound instead of the ordinary
clear, sonorous one of health. The position of the patient
when erect, by causing the fluid to descend, may allow of
the respiratory murmur being heard at the upper part of
the chest; and it may be perceived in front, but not behind,
when he lies on his back, until the cavity is filled, when the
sound altogether ceases. At the spot in the back corresponding
to the root of the lung, or at any other point at
which a previously formed adhesion may retain the lung
against the wall of the chest, some respiratory murmur may
yet be distinguished, until this part of the lung shall also
have yielded to the general compression, so as to be temporarily
impervious, or have become solidified under the continuance
and extension of disease. While this is taking
place in the affected side, the other lung is called upon to
make up the work of aerification of the blood; it labors
harder, its functions become more energetic, and that side of
the chest is more distended; the respirations become quicker,
fuller, and louder, and the vesicular murmur is said to resemble
that of a child&mdash;in fact, to be <i>puerile</i>.</p>

<p>When the lung begins to be compressed by the circumambient
fluid and the respiratory murmur ceases, a peculiar
modification of the respiration through the large bronchial
tubes may be heard, constituting <i>bronchial</i> respiration. It
occurs in pneumonia, in pulmonary apoplexy, and in tubercular
disease when the lung is solidified. When the voice is
heard through the stethoscope in these complaints, the peculiar
sound emitted is called <i>bronchophony</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
In pleuritic effusion, the voice, when carefully examined,
sometimes obtains a character not previously noticed, but of
comparatively little importance, called <i>œgophony</i>, a sound
which may be easily confounded with bronchophony, of the
latter of which it is a modification more often alluded to
than observed. Laennec says: “Simple œgophony consists
in a peculiar resonance of the voice, which accompanies or
follows the articulation of words. It appears to be sharper
than natural, more acute and somewhat silvery, vibrating, as
it were, on the surface of the lung more as an echo of the
voice than as the voice itself. It rarely enters the tube of
the stethoscope, less frequently traverses it completely. It
has besides another peculiar character, which is constant, and
from which I have taken its name. It is a trembling, bleating,
or shaking sound, like that of a goat, the tone of which
animal it greatly resembles. When it occurs near a large
bronchial tube, as in the root of the lungs, a more or less
marked bronchophony is often superadded.” This sound
may pervade the whole side; it is usually, however, most
distinct near the inferior angle of the scapula, the patient
being erect. It only exists where the effused fluid is small
in quantity, and is never a dangerous symptom; its return,
after it has been present and has disappeared, is a sign that
a part of the effused fluid has been removed. It is a sign
principally of value in distinguishing between pleuritis and
pleuro-pneumonia and pure pneumonia, in which latter disease
it is not heard, as in that complaint fluid is not thrown
out into the cavity of the pleura.</p>

<p>301. In pneumonia or inflammation of the substance of
the lung, as distinct from any implication of the pleura,
which, however, most frequently obtains after blows on, and
in cases of penetrating wounds of, the chest, the symptoms
differ. The ordinary febrile symptoms are similar to those
of pleurisy, only more intense; they usually precede for a
day or two the local symptoms of difficult respiration, pain,
and cough. The dyspnœa varies in different people. In
some it is only a slight embarrassment of breathing, admitting
of partial removal by accelerating the number of the
respirations, which are augmented from twenty to thirty,
forty, and upwards, and in children to sixty and seventy,
marking a great degree of distress and of extent of inflammation,
from which, when they are so frequent, persons
rarely recover. The patient can scarcely speak or lie down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and is obliged to be supported in that which he finds to be
the least uneasy position. Pain is not always present; it is
even said to be more frequently absent when the substance
of the lung is affected, and not the pleura. That pain is
not a necessary concomitant of pneumonia, is admitted, but
that it is usually present, and with great intensity in many
cases, cannot be doubted. When present, it is usually an
early symptom, deep seated below the sternum, under the
breast, extending to the scapula. When in the sides it is
more acute and fixed, and is probably conjoined with the
pain of pleurisy.</p>

<p>The pulse is quick and sharp, occasionally full and hard,
at the commencement of this complaint in young and healthy
persons, although it is sometimes small and weak from the
beginning, where there is little general power; but this
rarely occurs in cases of injury, and is not to be relied upon
in opposition to other symptoms.</p>

<p>The <i>cough</i> is usually dry in the commencement of idiopathic
pneumonia, rarely recurring by paroxysms, and is
without any particular indication; it is soon, however, accompanied
with a slight mucous expectoration, which, after some
twenty-four or forty-eight hours, begins to assume certain
and peculiar characters of the utmost importance as indicating
the existence and the different stages of the disease.
On the second or third day the expectoration becomes
bloody. Each sputum, spit, or <i>crachat</i> of the French is
composed of mucus intimately combined with blood&mdash;that
is, not simple streaks or striæ of blood, as in catarrh; nor
is it pure blood, as in hemoptysis. Each sputum is either
of a yellow, or rusty, or even red color, according to the
quantity of blood intimately mixed with the mucus. These
sputa are at the same time tenacious and viscous, adhering
so intimately together as to form a homogeneous transparent
whole, readily gliding, however, from the basin in which they
are held on sufficient inclination being given to it. At this
period or stage of the disease, the sputa adhere strongly to
each other, but the mass is not sufficiently viscid to stick to
the sides of the vessel. When no further change takes place
in the sputa the inflammation rarely passes beyond the first
stage of obstruction or engorgement, or swelling. When
they attain to a more viscous state, and adhere to the inside
of the vessel in which they have been received, the progress
of the inflammation to the second stage, or that of hepatiza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>tion,
may be feared. In almost every case where the viscidity
of the expectorated matter increases, respiration becomes
dull or bronchial, percussion of the chest yields a duller
sound than before, and the inflammation has attained its
highest degree. The expectoration, after being some time
stationary, changes its character. If the complaint is to
terminate by resolution, or by death, or to pass into a
chronic state, the redness and viscidity gradually diminish,
and at last disappear. If the rust color and the viscidity
should return, there has been a relapse, which the reappearance
of the other symptoms will show. When the inflammation
is of the most serious nature, and about to terminate
fatally, the expectoration diminishes, and at last ceases. In
some cases it only diminishes because it cannot be discharged;
it accumulates in the trachea, in the larynx, and
in the bronchi, until the patient is destroyed. In some rare
cases the matter secreted is spit up nearly to the last, and in
others, still more rare, the approach of death in the last
stage is characterized by a brown expectoration which cannot
be mistaken for either of the others which preceded it.
If the pneumonia pass into the chronic state, the expectoration
becomes yellowish, or somewhat greenish, and at last is
purely catarrhal.</p>

<p>Delirium is not an uncommon symptom when the inflammation
of the lung is intense in persons of powerful constitutions,
particularly during the exacerbation of fever in the
night. It yields with the other symptoms when relief is obtained.
When, however, it comes on at a later period of
the complaint, or when the accompanying fever is not purely
inflammatory, or in persons weakened by exhaustion and
privation, it is usually a fatal symptom if continued. When
mild, it often occurs after repeated and efficient bleedings,
which have subdued, but not entirely removed the disease;
and yields to opiates and gentle stimulants, by which the
pain is removed, although it sometimes remains in a milder
degree than before.</p>

<p>The ear discovers, soon after the commencement of the
disease, that the natural murmur cannot be distinctly heard,
it having been at first partly obscured, and after a time
entirely superseded by a peculiar noise, called a crepitating
or crepitous rattle or rhonchus. In its purest state it has
been likened to the sound of a lock of hair rubbed close to
the ear, or to that made by rumpling a fine piece of parch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>ment;
or again, to that which is produced by what under
ordinary circumstances is called the crepitation of salt, when
scattered in small quantities on red-hot coals. This crepitating
rhonchus is heard at first in a small part of the lung,
generally at the lower rather than at the upper part; it
marks the first stage of the disease. It is not of long continuance;
the vesicular murmur is either restored, or the
crepitating rhonchus ceases to be heard, in consequence of
the second stage to this, or that of hepatization, having
commenced; the small air-vesicles are no longer pervious;
the sound of the breathing, which is now heard, is that of
the air more forcibly driven into the larger bronchial tubes
causing <i>bronchial respiration</i>, which is no longer a vesicular
or crepitating, but a whiffing sound, like that caused by
blowing forcibly through a quill, or as if little gusts of air
were blown in or blown out. The voice betrays to the ear
of the auscultator another sign; it descends into the pervious
bronchi, and being conveyed to the ear through the
solid lung, gives rise to that peculiarity of voice called
<i>bronchophony</i>, a correct knowledge of which can only be
acquired by repeated observation.</p>

<p>When the inflammation of the lung is confined to a small
and deeply-seated spot, auscultation may not at first reveal
the evil; or it may possibly be overlooked, through the
sound part of the lung becoming more active, and giving
forth in consequence a stronger and more puerile breathing,
which may mislead the listener.</p>

<p>When the vesicular murmur cannot be heard, when the
<i>rhonchus</i> or <i>crepitating râle</i> or sound is not present, and
bronchial respiration and bronchophony only can be distinguished,
the case is one of great anxiety and danger.
The second stage of hepatization is passing into the third,
or purulent infiltration, of which auscultation shows no
further signs, although the matter secreted may be expectorated,
in proof of what has taken place. Pus is thus formed,
which it is steadily maintained by some pathologists is not
deposited in the form of abscess, but is infiltrated throughout
the parenchymatous substance of the lung, finding its
way into larger bronchial tubes, or being poured out from
some parts of their secreting surface; the accuracy of this
statement, however, as a rule, may be doubted, from some
dissections having proved the reverse.</p>

<p>302. The effects of inflammation of the pleura are well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
marked; the first is to diminish, if not to annul, the secretion
of the exhalation, or halitus, by which it is lubricated;
so that its surfaces can no longer glide without noise upon
each other. The patient is often made aware of the difference
by some uneasy internal sensation; the auscultator, by
a rubbing or creaking sound emitted as the inflamed pleuræ,
no longer smooth and polished, rub against each other, and
become covered by a thick, effused matter, although not
actually separated by a liquid. It is a sound which cannot
exist after separation has taken place by the intervention of
a fluid, or after adhesions have formed; it is, therefore, an
early and transitory sign, is frequently interrupted, and returns,
as if by jerks, three or four times repeated in succession.
The pleura when inspected, after being attacked by
inflammation, shows at first but little sign of derangement
on its serous surface. It quickly, however, exhibits numberless
small vessels, carrying red blood, which are principally
seated in the sub-serous cellular tissue, reddening the membrane
more deeply in one part than another. These soon
begin to take on a new action, leading to the deposition of
coagulable lymph or fibrin, which adheres to the inflamed
surfaces. These deposits soon assume the determinate form
of very thin layers, constituting what are called false membranes;
while a serous or sero-purulent effusion takes place,
even to filling the cavity of the chest, and which may or may
not be ultimately absorbed. When coagulable lymph is first
deposited, and about to form a false membrane, it is soft, of
a grayish-white color, and does not possess any appearances
of organization. Red points are, after a time, perceived in
it, which soon become red lines or streaks, on the surface.
This organization of the lymph does not depend on the
period which has elapsed from the commencement of the
complaint. It is seen in the first day of the disease in some
cases; it is altogether absent in others, and depends much
on the state and habit of the patient. The lymph is sometimes
deposited in small drops or spots; in others, in
patches of a greater or less size, varying according to the
extent of the inflammation which has produced them. When
a false membrane is once fully formed, it becomes itself a
secreting surface, and may go on augmenting its thickness
to so great a degree as materially to diminish the cavity of
the chest. I have seen the pleura with a solid deposit of
this kind much more than an inch in thickness. In general,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
it is found in distinct layers, superimposed one upon the
other. Whatever may be their thickness, they commonly
admit of being separated from each other. The false membranes
thus formed, resembling areolar tissue in their properties,
may ultimately become cartilaginous, and even bony.
When simple adhesions form between the pleuræ, they become
lengthened with time; and, although they impede the
motion of the lung at first, and may give rise to some uneasy
sensations, they gradually become elongated, and give no
further inconvenience. The fluid thrown out is serous; is
often mingled with flocculi or lymph, which are seen floating
in it; it is therefore more or less turbid, resembling whey.
It is often nearly colorless and transparent; when the consequence
of injury, it is often tinged with blood, forced out
from the capillary vessels of the pleura, or of the false membrane,
if not caused by the deposition of the fluid coagulated
in the first instance after the receipt of the injury.</p>

<p>The quantity of fluid thus thrown out varies from an
ounce to several pints; it gravitates according to the position
of the patient, unless, when from old adhesions between
the pleuræ, it is confined to particular parts. When the
cavity of the pleuræ is free, and the fluid is in quantity, it
compresses the lung, and diminishes its size by pressing or
squeezing the air out of it; it is thus pressed toward the
vertebral column, and so greatly diminished in size and augmented
in density as to be useless for the purposes of respiration.
While the lung is undergoing this compression
to its utmost, the mediastinum also yields, and bulges into
the opposite side of the chest, carrying the heart more or
less with it; so that when the left side of the thorax is thus
affected, the heart is seen and heard to beat on the right.
The diaphragm now yields in turn, more on the left than on
the right side, from the obstacle to its descent afforded by
the liver. The intercostal muscles and ribs resist the internal
pressure for a considerable length of time, even for
weeks; they at last, however, yield; the ribs may even turn
a little outward, while the interspaces in thin persons are
said to fill out, so as to render that side of the chest nearly
smooth, the size of that side, when measured, being larger
than the other, in some instances even by two inches, but
this rarely occurs unless the fluid within is purulent, and the
disease of long standing.</p>

<p>303. After a time, and particularly in wounds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
chest, the effused fluid becomes purulent, the lung, compressed
to a small, flattened surface, adheres to the spine
by what was its root, if no adventitious attachments have
retained it in a different position; and the pleura has become
a thick, yellowish-white, irregular, honey-combed sort
of covering for it, as well as completely lining the chest.
The serous as well as the purulent effusion are both free
from any unpleasant odor; unless a kind of gangrene has
taken place, when the latter becomes very offensive, and of
a greenish-black color, as well as the substance of the false
membranes extending to and sometimes beneath the pleura
covering the condensed lung, into which openings have even
thus been made.</p>

<p>In some cases the surface of the pleura is covered with
small tubercles, some as large as a filbert; in others it appears
to have a reticular or honey-combed appearance; and
in particular cases, large irregularities or excavations may
be observed in it when much thickened, being evidently
spots of ulceration, which, if they had proceeded, would
have ended by allowing passage to the matter outward,
until it formed an external abscess, implicating in all probability
one or more of the ribs; thus giving rise to an
exfoliation which, by being separated internally, might in
time be the cause of further mischief, if not previously
covered by a thin layer of false membrane. When chronic
pleurisy succeeds to a more acute attack, or they alternate
with each other, particularly after penetrating wounds of
the chest, several layers seem to be laid down one upon the
other. This deposit is never so thick upon the pleura
pulmonalis; nevertheless it is thick enough in most instances
to prevent the lung from again dilating, the substance
of it being generally quite permeable to, although
so compressed as to be deprived of, air. It is then flattened,
drawn upward toward its root against the mediastinum
and spinal column, unless by some previous adhesion such
a course has been prevented, and it adheres, as it has been
often known to do, to the side of the chest. As that adhesion
may occur in more than one spot, so may the
effusions or deposits take place between them, constituting
circumscribed sacs, and rendering the case more complicated.</p>

<p>304. The changes which take place in the structure of
the lung in pneumonia are three in number: 1. Engorge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>ment.
2. Hepatization. 3. Purulent infiltration. The
formation of an abscess or vomica, and the occurrence of
gangrene, may be omitted, as well as of chronic disorders,
in the views about to be taken of the disease from injury.</p>

<p>In the first stage of inflammatory obstruction, or that
of engorgement, the lung has assumed externally a livid-red
or violet color. It is heavier and firmer than in its healthy
state, and the natural feeling of crepitation, although greatly
diminished, is not extinct. The lung retains the impression
of the finger, and pits on pressure as if it contained a liquid,
although air-bubbles can yet be distinguished in it, and its
cellular or spongy texture is still to be observed. On cutting
into it, a quantity of sanguineous or turbid fluid flows
from it, mingled with numerous minute air-bubbles. In some
places the color of the incised surface is darker and more
compact, showing that some progress has been made toward
the stage of hepatization. It nevertheless tears with greater
facility than in a healthy state.</p>

<p>In the second stage, or that of the red softening of Andral,
the hepatization of Laennec&mdash;the latter term being in most
common use, from the lung assuming somewhat the appearance
of liver in solidity and weight&mdash;the lung does not crepitate,
no air-bubbles pass out of it, but a thick, bloody fluid
exudes on pressure, and it sinks for the most part in water.
The color is somewhat less red or violet than in the first
stage, and lighter and more varied in color when cut into.
The openings of the larger vessels and of the bronchi, when
cut across, are observed as white specs; the interlobular
tissue is thicker and more marked in lines running in different
directions; while many little granular points can be discovered,
especially with a glass, apparently of a more solid
material than the surrounding parts.</p>

<p>The word solidity, or solidification, is sufficiently explanatory
in contradistinction to the naturally pervious and crepitating
state of the lung. Andral believed that hepatization
arises from an excessive congestion of blood, and not from
any deposition of lymph. It is not easy, however, to understand,
in the present state of our knowledge, how acute
inflammation can go on for three or more days without
secretion and deposition being added to congestion. That
hepatization, or impermeability to air, may take place in the
typhoid pneumonia in twenty-four hours, and that it as
suddenly seems to be removed, is hardly conclusive, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
shows merely that a thoroughly well-loaded lung ceases to
be permeable to air until a part of the load shall have been
displaced.</p>

<p>When the lung, inflamed to the second stage, or that of
hepatization, is about to be restored to a state of health, a
slight crepitation or crackling begins again to be heard
at the end of each inspiration; and as this increases, (the
rhonchus crepitans redux of Laennec,) the bronchial respiration
and voice gradually, or after a time, diminish, until
they entirely disappear; while a mucous râle or rattle commences,
the index of that free expectoration by which
pneumonia usually terminates.</p>

<p>In the third stage of morbid change, or that of purulent
infiltration, the lung is of a lighter color, from the intermixture
of a new matter in its substance, although in the
first degree it preserves its firmness and granular structure.
The new secretion is of an opaque, straw or yellow color,
and puriform in its nature. This is discoverable more
particularly in spots; but as the disease proceeds, it pervades
the whole substance of the lung, which becomes
softer and more moist, and is easily broken down by the
fingers, the granular structure having disappeared. It is
more or less a purulent sort of sponge, in which all of the
lung that can be perceived under a strong light may be
resolved into small blood-vessels, bronchial tubes, and interlobular
septa.</p>

<p>These three degrees or stages of inflammation may be
met with in the same lung, for the most part gradually intermingling
one with the other. The lower part of the lung
being ordinarily first affected, is usually the seat of the
purulent infiltration of the third stage; while in the tubercular
affection, which ends in phthisis, the disease commonly
begins in the upper part.</p>

<p>Resolution or recovery from even this, the last of the
morbid changes which have been observed, may take place,
although it is less likely to do so after idiopathic than
traumatic inflammation, in which the lung was previously
healthy, and the constitution unimpaired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p class="h2sub">GENERAL BLOOD-LETTING, ETC.</p>

<p>305. The first and most essential remedy in the treatment
of pleuritis and pneumonia from injury is bleeding, which
should be resorted to in every case, whenever the febrile
excitement is really inflammatory. All old people, under
such circumstances, unless in a cachectic state, bear at least
one bleeding well; they often bear more; and no fact is
more important, in opposition to the opinions commonly
entertained on this subject. In young people, who have not
been reduced in health and strength by privations and hard
service, the bleeding should be repeated until the desired
object has been effected; the quantity required to be drawn
in inflammation, particularly after <i>injuries</i>, is often very
great. It may almost become a question, in some cases,
whether a patient shall be allowed to die of the disease, or
from loss of blood; for convalescence is rapid in proportion
as the inflammation is of small extent, and has been early
subdued. As the first stage of pneumonia only lasts from
twelve hours to three days before it passes into the second,
and the second from one day to three before matter begins
to be deposited, no time should be lost to prevent these evils
taking place, if the patient is to be saved, without incurring
a risk, from which few escape with health, even if life be
ultimately preserved. Bleeding in inflammation of the
pleura, in <i>young</i> and <i>healthy</i> persons, should therefore be
effected with an unsparing hand, until an impression has
been made on the system&mdash;until the pain and the difficulty
of breathing have been removed&mdash;until the patient can draw
a full breath, or faints; and the operation should be repeated,
from time to time, every three or four hours, according to
the intensity of the recurrence, or the persistence of the
essential symptoms. The pulse does not often indicate the
extent or severity of the inflammation, although it often
expresses the amount of the constitutional irritability of the
person. It is sometimes exceedingly illusory as a guide,
and is never to be depended upon in the earlier stages of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
disease, when accompanied by pain and great oppression of
breathing. Whenever the pulsations of the heart are proportionally
much stronger than those of the arteries, we
may bleed without fear, and with the certainty of finding
the pulse rise; but if the heart and pulse are both weak,
the abstraction of blood will almost always occasion complete
prostration of strength, and may be fatal.</p>

<p>306. When many years ago in charge of a regiment of
infantry, on the top of the Berry Head, the outermost
point of Torbay, the men thus greatly exposed were attacked
by pneumonia. According to the practice taught
in London, I bled my patients three and four times in the
first forty-eight hours. I first drew sixteen ounces, then
fourteen, then twelve, then abstracted, as the complaint
continued, eight ounces; gave tartar emetic, so as to keep
up nausea; then calomel, antimony, and opium, and lost
my patients. I examined the bodies of all, and found that
they had lived to what is now called the third stage of
pneumonia, combined in almost all with pleuritis, with effusion,
and the formation of false membranes. The disease
was essentially a pleuro-pneumonia, varying in different
degrees, as the pleura or the lungs were principally affected;
and I saw with regret that the disease had not in any way
been arrested; that the means employed had been insufficient.
What was to be done? My sixteen ounces of blood
were increased to thirty, but it would not do. It was evident
that, to succeed, no limit should be placed to the
abstraction of blood in the first instance, but the decided
incapability of bearing its further loss. Every man was
therefore bled, when he came into the hospital, until he
fainted, and the bleeding was repeated every four hours, or
even oftener, as long as pain or difficulty of breathing
remained; under this improved practice all recovered.</p>

<p>The lesson learned at Berry Head was not forgotten
during the five subsequent years passed in British North
America. The men were as healthy, the winds were sharper
and colder, the vicissitudes of all kinds greater. Rum was
cheaper, newer, and stronger than the gin of Torbay. The
local inflammations were often as severe, whether of the
pleura or of the lungs, and by no means less so of the bowels.
A grenadier, some six feet three inches high, broad, and well
framed in proportion, had drank a gallon of rum during the
afternoon, and very narrowly escaped, even with the loss of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
nearly as much of his blood, abstracted in a few hours. His
first bleeding was into the washhand-basin, until he fainted,
lying on his back, and the bleedings were repeated as soon
as he began to feel pain, and whenever he felt a return of
the pain he used to put his arm out of bed to have the vein
reopened, for Jack Martin was a very gallant fellow. This
is given as an extreme case, to be borne in mind under circumstances
somewhat similar, particularly after injuries. In
common cases of well-marked pleuritis from injury in strong
and <i>healthy</i> persons, it is now not unusual to abstract blood
by those who rely on its efficiency, until the pain and difficulty
of breathing are relieved, or fainting is about to take
place. The patient should be raised in bed, the opening in
the vein should be large, the flow of blood free. The quantity
will vary from sixteen ounces to three times that amount
in different people; but the important point is to repeat it
as soon as the pain or difficulty in breathing returns. It
rarely happens that one bleeding, to whatever extent it may
be carried, will suffice to remove the symptoms; and recurrence
should be had to this remedy as often as the pain and
oppression require, and <span class="allsmcap">THE FORCE OF THE HEART</span> will bear
it, especially during the first two or three days. It will often
be necessary to have recourse to it in smaller quantities for
the next four or six days, and again in less quantity on any
return of the inflammatory symptoms. Where the patient
is likely to faint, he should be bled in the recumbent position;
and as it is advisable to take away a sufficient quantity
of blood, great care should be taken, by arresting its
flow for a time, by giving stimulants, by admitting fresh air,
and by sprinkling with cold water, to prevent syncope, which
is sometimes dangerous in elderly persons, who may be subject
to and who are not readily recovered from it. In the
second stage of the complaint, profuse and repeated bleedings
do not answer as well; they do not remove the evil
which has occurred, although they may prevent its increase.
Blood should then be drawn in such quantity only as will
relieve the action of the heart, restless under its efforts to
propel the blood through a hepatized lung. The quickness
of pulse, the cough, the difficulty of breathing, must now be
aided and relieved by other means; for although the pulse
is not a certain indication, on which dependence can be
placed in the early stage of this complaint, the breathing
generally is; and as long as the respiration is oppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
blood should be carefully abstracted, until it becomes manifest
that the effect has been to quicken the pulse, while it
materially diminishes its power, when it is forbidden.</p>

<p>307. A cupped and buffy state of the blood, together with
a firm coagulum, is a satisfactory proof of the propriety of
bleeding in the first stage of the disease; but after the effect
of mercury on the system has been produced, it cannot be
depended upon with the same degree of certainty. When
the propriety of further venesection is doubtful, the greatest
advantage may be obtained from the use of leeches and from
cupping, particularly in cases of injury to the chest. Leeches
may be applied by tens and twenties at a time; and when
they have ceased to bleed into a warm bread and water or
evaporating poultice, they may be replaced by as many more,
until the pain and the oppression are removed. Cupping is
always to be had recourse to when leeches cannot be obtained,
and, when well done, it is frequently to be preferred; cupping
to sixteen ounces will usually be found equivalent to
forty or more leeches. Both these means often relieve to a
greater extent, with less general depression, than a smaller
quantity of blood taken from the arm, and are, therefore, at
such times more advisable. When blood cannot be obtained
from the veins, the arteries must furnish it; and both temporal
arteries have been opened with the best effect in
injuries of the chest, when blood could not be obtained from
the arm, or from the external jugular vein.</p>

<p>308. The effects of bleeding were of old found to be different
under different circumstances and in different climates.
Asclepiades remarks that while phlebotomy was fatal at
Rome and at Athens, it was beneficial in the Hellespont.
Nevertheless, at a much later period, Baglivi says: “In
Romano, phlebotomia est princeps remedium in plenritide.”</p>

<p>In the Crimea blood-letting has not been so favorably
viewed, nor found so serviceable nor so necessary; although
the abstraction of smaller quantities than those indicated
above, and less frequently repeated, has been found eminently
beneficial, the difference being dependent on climate
and the impaired vigor of the sufferers.</p>

<p>The remedy first to be administered, and most to be depended
upon in the first stage, is tartar emetic, which usually
gives rise to vomiting, purging, and possibly to sweating; it
should not be omitted because such effects are produced in
the first instance. After a few, perhaps three or four doses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
the vomiting usually ceases, the stomach tolerates its introduction,
and its gradual increase from six to nine, twelve,
twenty, or more grains in the twenty-four hours, is often
borne not only with impunity, but with great advantage.
Vomiting and purging are not desirable, as the effects of
tartar emetic are more rapid and beneficial when they give
rise to no particular evacuation beyond that of general perspiration.
The most valuable remark of Laennec on its use
is, “that by bleeding we almost always obtain a diminution
of the fever, of the oppression, and of the bloody expectoration,
so as to lead the patients and the attendants to believe
that recovery is about to take place; after a few hours, however,
the unfavorable symptoms return with fresh vigor;
and the same scene is renewed often five or six times after
as many venesections. On the other hand, I can state that
I have never witnessed these renewed attacks under the use
of tartar emetic.” He further says that the same favorable
results do not occur from its use in pleurisy or in inflammation
of serous membranes, as in pneumonia.</p>

<p>309. Mercury is a remedy of the greatest importance in
serous inflammations, such as pleuritis, although of less value
than tartar emetic in the first stage of pneumonia, than which
it would appear to be more efficient in the later period of the
stages of hepatization and infiltration, though some physicians
place entire confidence on its efficacy in all. It is of
most value when combined with opium. Some suppose that
the opium merely prevents the irregular action of the mercury;
others, in some papers printed in the journals for 1801,
state that opium has a distinct curative effect, being capable,
when given in large doses, of subduing inflammation, and
more particularly of allaying pain, relieving the cough and
irritation, and of procuring sleep; in which opinion I fully
concur. Opium is highly advantageous in irritable and
nervous persons, and will frequently relieve the nervous
pain, the pleurodynia which remains after pleuritis, when
nothing else succeeds. Calomel in large doses is usually
preferred to all other forms, but a difference of opinion has
occurred as to what is a large dose; whether two, three,
four, six, ten, or twelve grains are large doses, and whether
they shall be given every one, two, three, four, or six hours.
It has been attempted to solve this question by supposing
that in highly inflammatory cases in healthy persons, from
three to six, and even to twelve grains, may be given twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
or three times a day, with better effect than smaller ones
more frequently repeated; but this has not been made
manifest.</p>

<p>In cases less inflammatory or complicated with gastric
derangement, the disease assuming more of a general than
of a local character, the excretions being vitiated, the skin
dry and hot, and the tongue loaded, from gr. iss to gr. iij
of calomel, combined with three grains of Dover’s powder,
may be advantageously given every second or third hour,
the great object being to affect the gums as quickly as possible.
This is not effected in some cases by any of the quantities
given until after a considerable lapse of time, while in
others it is accomplished by less than half a dozen grains of
the remedy. It has not been ascertained that twenty-four
or forty grains given in two or four doses in twenty-four
hours will affect the mouth more rapidly than three grains
every two hours for the same time, neither is it less liable to
cause irritation; while the third or half a grain of opium
given every two hours seems to keep up the effect of that
remedy with great advantage. It does not materially signify
which method is adopted in strong and healthy persons,
although the smaller doses are most satisfactory to all parties
when the patient is weak and irritable, while the large
and less frequent doses often excite great apprehension. It
is argued that calomel in large doses never causes the dysentery
nor the severe ptyalism produced by smaller doses;
that it acts more quickly, and that after giving twenty
grains, and repeating it in six hours, any other medicines may
be given without interfering with it, although the strictest
attention must be paid to diet, generally confining it to very
small sups of warm whey. Very serious derangements do,
however, follow the exhibition of the large as well as of the
small doses, inasmuch as it is impossible to know beforehand
what quantity will cause a severe salivation or diarrhœa,
which it may be difficult to arrest.</p>

<p>310. It may be concluded that, of the two heroic internal
remedies, tartar emetic and calomel, recommended for the
cure of inflammation of the chest, tartar emetic is the more
appropriate for inflammation of the lungs or pneumonia,
provided it be not accompanied by symptoms of gastric inflammation;
in which case its use should be superseded by
leeches to the epigastrium, and saline aperients, lest the irritation,
vomiting, and purging should increase the evil. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
care must be taken that one inflammation shall not be
allowed to increase, while attention is principally paid to
the other, and symptoms of irritation, the <i>gastro-enterite</i>
of the French physicians, are not to be mistaken for gastritis.
Mercury, in the form of calomel, is more to be depended
upon in inflammation of the pleura, over which, as
well as over inflammation of serous membranes in other parts
of the body, it exercises a remarkable influence.</p>

<p>311. Blisters are never useful during the continuance of
acute inflammation of the chest, although their use is indicated
when the patient is much exhausted, the pulse weak,
and the breathing continues difficult; or in cases in which
the disease proceeds slowly, or is becoming chronic, when
they often do much good. The same may be said of dry
cupping, mustard poultices, and other cutaneous rubefacients,
such as the ol. terebinth. used hot, which often do
much good in the commencement and termination of slight
attacks, or of their supervention on chronic disease, or after
injuries.</p>

<p>In the acute stages simple drinks only should be allowed.
As soon as the inflammatory action has subsided, the lightest
farinaceous nourishment, gradually augmented by the addition
of broths, jellies, eggs, fish, and lastly of animal food,
should be substituted. The temperature of the room ought
to be moderate and equal.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the lungs frequently terminates by the
deposition of a white or lateritious sediment in the urine,
which is considered a critical evacuation, not however to be
relied upon, unless accompanied by a remission of the important
symptoms. A moderate diarrhœa and a profuse
perspiration are also signs of a favorable crisis.</p>

<p>312. Inflammation of the chest has been hitherto considered
as accompanied by inflammatory fever as an essential
character, but this is by no means always the case. In
large cities, and among troops after hard service, in which
they have been subjected to much privation, and in certain
epidemics, the accompanying fever often partakes of a low
or typhoid character, and becomes infinitely more dangerous.
This modification of disease I have known from my earliest
years, in different climates, in all of which it proved most
fatal. It is a disease formed of a local inflammation accompanied
by general symptoms of a low asthenic type of fever,
combined with those of marked derangement of the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
intestines, or liver, as shown by a dry black, or red black, or
brown tongue, offensive breath, diarrhœa, vomiting of a dark-colored
or greenish fluid, watery or sanious expectoration,
great thirst, headache, a feeble and quick pulse, low delirium,
and great prostration of strength. It was marked, on the
banks of the Guadiana, by the discharge of lumbrici by the
mouth and by the anus. This disease has always appeared
to arise from peculiar circumstances, and to disappear when
they ceased to exist; such as great privations and exposure
to cold and fatigue, the use of ardent spirits without sufficient
food, bad air, or other depressing causes. It is sometimes
epidemic. The fever is typhoid, the local inflammation
latent, and the symptoms of it masked. It may be
complicated with inflammation of the stomach and intestines;
it may occur in cases of erysipelas, or after wounds
or injuries attended with large secretions of purulent matter,
or with other complaints. While the symptoms of low
fever are general and well marked, those of the latent affection
of the lung are not so prominent or even observable.
The patient complains but little, and sometimes not at all, of
his chest, until attention is drawn to it by a slight cough,
and difficulty of respiration, attended by a character of
countenance which usually indicates embarrassment in the
functions of the lung. It may be brought on by a common
non-penetrating injury of the chest.</p>

<p>In typhoid pneumonia, general bleeding, if admissible, is
to be had recourse to with extreme caution, even in young
and robust persons. Local depletion is oftentimes useful,
and perhaps ought to be alone relied upon. The great
dependence is on calomel and opium, and after such local
depletion as may be thought advisable, counter-irritation by
blistering, and the administration of stimulants, such as
camphor, ammonia, and wine, in small and repeated quantities.
Mild aperients only should be employed, and anodyne
injections are frequently useful. While auscultation
has thrown a clear and steady light on the nature of the
mischief which is going on, it has added little or nothing
dissimilar to the practice pursued some forty years ago.
The nature of the hepatization or solidification which takes
place in the lung in typhoid pneumonia has given rise to
some difference of opinion among morbid anatomists, who
incline to believe, from the rapidity with which it takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
place, and with which it is sometimes removed, that it depends
more on passive congestion, and on a typhoid alteration
of the state of the blood, than on an altered action in
the vessels of the part. This opinion does not seem to be
fully supported by dissection, unless it be generally admitted
that gray hepatization, and the third stage of disease of the
lungs in pneumonia, mean simple congestion.</p>

<p>When the patient survives the imminence of danger in
which he is placed by the attack of the disease, and the expectoration
becomes copious, with great emaciation, quick
pulse, and hectic fever, a slight infusion of senega or of
cinchona with ammonia, with a mild and well-regulated diet,
and change of air and climate, answer best in aiding recovery.</p>

<p>A typhoid pleuritis is presumed to exist, as a distinct disease
from typhoid pneumonia, although the analogy between
them is admitted to be close; like it the disease is latent
and more frequently pointed out by the sinking of the powers
of life than by any new suffering. The signs of effusion
may be discovered on auscultation, and the treatment is
essentially similar; blistering and counter-irritants being
perhaps more useful, if time be granted for their application.</p>

<p>313. Empyema, <i>from</i> εν, <i>in</i>, <i>and</i> πυον, <i>pus</i>,&mdash;a name
given to all collections of fluids in, and to the operation for
evacuating them from, the cavity of the chest. Empyema is
not a special disease, but the result of another; commonly
of acute or chronic pleurisy, or of injuries of the chest, which
give rise to inflammation, ending in suppuration. When it
occurs from the effusion of a serous fluid, constituting a local
dropsy, it is usually the result of disease of the heart, or of
the great vessels, and is accompanied or preceded by symptoms
indicating the existence of those complaints, in which
case it is not likely to be benefited by any operation. The
disease is then denominated hydrothorax. The serous fluid
is generally transparent, although more or less tinged with
blood, when thrown out in persons who die within a few
days after receiving a wound of the chest. It may, and
does occasionally, contain in these cases a large quantity of
blood; but an early effusion of blood is not uncommon in
very acute cases of pleuritis. It is usually more or less turbid
when the result of ordinary inflammation, although the
presence of albuminous or purulent matter is not constant.
Whether colorless, transparent, turbid, or purulent, it remains
free from fetor, unless gangrene has occurred inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>nally,
or some communication with the atmosphere has taken
place by an external opening.</p>

<p>While the fluid remains transparent, the appearance of
the pleura is little changed, but when it has become turbid
in any great degree, or flocculent, or purulent, the pleura
has lost its natural appearance. In its simplest character,
when the fluid is puriform, particularly if the inflammation
have not been very active, it is covered with a layer of whitish
inorganic sediment, which can be scraped off by the scalpel.
This is sometimes quite red, as if loaded with blood which
had been deposited upon it. Whenever pleuritic symptoms
continue beyond the ordinary period of about three weeks,
or, after a temporary abatement, are followed by those of
effusion, which are not in turn removed, the occurrence of
empyema may be suspected.</p>

<p>Empyema may form from a pulmonic abscess bursting, or
a gangrenous spot being detached and falling into the cavity
of the pleura. An abscess in the liver or other parts may
also communicate with the pleura, and abscesses formed from
injury or otherwise in the wall of the chest may also give
rise to it. It is usually, however, caused by acute inflammation,
by penetrating injuries, or by the introduction of foreign
substances. It should, however, be borne in mind that when
it occurs from wounds, the external opening must have healed,
or the complaint would be simply a wound in the chest, with
a discharge from the cavity of the side affected. A true surgical
case of empyema, following an injury of the chest, in
which the wound has healed, is not to be ascertained but by
the same means as in a case arising entirely from internal
causes, unless the protrusion of the cicatrix should indicate
the presence of matter behind it.</p>

<p>314. The symptoms by which the termination of inflammation
in effusion may be known: are dyspnœa, or difficulty
of breathing, which is greater when the effusion has taken
place rapidly, less when it has been gradual; subsidence of
pain; inability to lie on the unaffected or sound side, which
subsides, or is entirely removed, after the operation has been
performed and the fluid evacuated, although it should be replaced
by air in consequence of the lung being unable to
resume its natural position. When the effused fluid has
filled one side of the chest, that side is evidently enlarged,
and this can be distinctly seen when the dilatation does not
exceed half an inch, measuring by a tape from the spinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
process of a vertebra behind to the center of the sternum.
The ribs are nearly, if not quite, immovable, and partially
raised, offering a strong contrast to the active motion of the
ribs on the other side. The intercostal spaces in these persons
may be more or less filled up, rendering the whole surface
smooth and soft. In some very severe cases the external
parts become edematous, so that the ribs cannot be felt,
and this sign, although not always present, is certainly pathognomonic
when it takes place at a late period of the disease.
When the effusion is into the left side of the chest,
the heart is frequently pushed over with the mediastinum to
the right side, and its pulsation can be seen and felt to the
right side of the sternum; or it may descend with the
diaphragm into the epigastrium&mdash;changes which are not so
extensive or remarkable when the effusion is into the right
side, as the liver materially impedes the descent of the
diaphragm, and the heart is already in the left side, in
which it is sometimes raised rather than depressed. It is
said that if the hand be placed over the affected side, while
the patient speaks with a tolerably loud voice, and a strong
vibration is felt in the part, the case is not one of empyema;
but this is as uncertain a sign and as little to be depended
upon as the dullness on percussion which sometimes takes
place under the sternum in empyema. The cough and
expectoration offer nothing peculiar, unless a communication
exist between the lung and the cavity of the chest, when the
expectoration in general becomes very fetid and disagreeable.
The febrile symptoms depend on the activity of the
previous disease, and the rapidity with which the effusion
has taken place.</p>

<p>Night-sweats, it has been supposed, never accompany the
hectic fever of empyema, unless there be tubercles in the
lungs or pleura&mdash;a remark which cannot be depended upon.</p>

<p>315. Two symptoms have been insisted upon by older
authors as distinctive of effusion in the chest, which more
modern ones are disposed to doubt, particularly in the early
stages of the disease. One is an edematous swelling of the
back, the other a protrusion of the intercostal spaces. A
third may be added when the effused fluid is blood, which is
that the edematous swelling becomes ecchymosed, or red,
or bruised looking, from the effusion of blood into the cellular
membrane beneath the skin, over the whole space occupied
by the blood within. That the first two symptoms do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
assuredly indicate the presence of pus, cannot be doubted;
and that the third is a sign that the effused fluid is blood,
has not been disproved; but it must be borne in mind that
they are late, not early symptoms, and the operation should
not be delayed until they are present, if other signs should
appear to demand its performance. Valentin was the first to
notice the ecchymosis of the side and back when the chest
was full of blood, a sign which Larrey particularly insists
upon, but which certainly does not appear so early as to be
distinctive, when other symptoms exist which almost render
it certain. The swelling does not arise from transudation
of matter through the pleura, but from irritation transmitted
through it, as in any other deep-seated abscess. Dilatation
of the chest is usually an early symptom, although a considerable
effusion may exist without it, or with but a slight
elevation of the intercostal spaces. When the complaint is
distinct, these spaces are elevated to a level with the ribs, so
that the surface becomes perfectly smooth and equal; a
farther protrusion is a very rare occurrence. Effusion indeed
of serous fluid to a considerable extent, so as to displace
the heart, may take place without the intercostal
spaces being elevated, which is only believed to occur when
the intercostal muscles have become paralyzed. When the
matter has been evacuated, the muscles recover their tone,
and the intercostal spaces reappear.</p>

<p>In all cases of empyema in which the lung is so bound
down by adhesions that it cannot be expanded by the continued
process of respiration, a cure can only be accomplished
by an alteration of the form of the affected side of
the chest, by which its cavity is diminished, and often nearly
obliterated. This is an effort of nature. The pleura changes
its character, becomes so thick as materially to diminish the
cavity, the diaphragm ascends, the heart leans to that side
in many instances, the spine curves, the ribs thicken and
become flatter, and close in upon each other, abolishing the
intercostal spaces.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i>&mdash;As long as the febrile symptoms consequent
on the inflammation continue to any extent, medicines will
be of but little avail, and counter-irritants should be avoided.
When they have subsided, purgatives and diaphoretics may
be tried, in combination with tonics and a light but good
nourishing diet. Blisters applied frequently upon a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
surface often do good. When these means fail, the operation
must be resorted to.</p>

<p>316. It has not been satisfactorily decided whether the
operation for empyema was first performed on Phalereus,
Jason, or Prometheus; it is therefore said of all three that,
being expected to die of an abscess in the lungs declared to
be incurable, they went into battle for the purpose of getting
killed; but being only run through the body, they all
recovered, in consequence of the escape of the purulent
matter through the holes thus made. The operation was
performed by Hippocrates and his successors, by the knife,
by caustic, and by the hot iron. Ambrose Paré was the
first who recommended a trocar and canula, and many instances
of success in all ways are recorded. The modern
methods are by the trocar and canula, and by incision.
Whenever auscultation, percussion, or succussion give reason
to believe that a fluid is collected, which medicine has
not been nor is able to remove, the simple operation by the
trocar and canula should be performed. If fluid should
pass through the small canula generally used by way of
exploration, a larger one may be introduced in its place if
thought advisable. In ordinary cases, the little wound
should be closed immediately after the evacuation of the
fluid; it usually heals without difficulty, and the operation
may be repeated if necessary. Care should be taken that
the point of the instrument is perfectly sharp, or it may
separate the thickened false membrane from the inside wall
of the chest, and, by pushing it before it, prevent the fluid
from passing through the canula when the trocar is withdrawn.</p>

<p>317. The place of election, in England, for a <i>puncture</i>,
in ordinary cases, is usually between the fifth and sixth ribs,
counting from above, and between the sixth and seventh
from below, and at one-third the distance from the spinous
processes of the vertebræ, or two-thirds from the middle of
the sternum. If there should be any protrusion of the intercostal
spaces, it may be a rib or two lower down. The
point of the instrument should be introduced a little nearer
the lower than the upper rib, and pressed on until all resistance
has been overcome. It is entered nearer the lower rib
to avoid the intercostal artery, and yet not touching the rib
lest it should induce a too forcible contraction of the inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>costal
muscles, by which the operator might be inconvenienced.</p>

<p>If the person should be very fat, or the puffing of the integuments
considerable, it may not be easy to feel the ribs,
in which case even recourse should not be had to incision.
When the arm is placed by the side, and bent forward at a
right angle so that the hand rests on the ensiform cartilage,
the inferior angle of the scapula will correspond in general,
but not always, with the interval between the seventh and
eighth ribs at the back part. The attachment, however, of
the last of the true ribs, the seventh, to the xyphoid cartilage,
can always be ascertained in front, and an error of importance
cannot well take place, as the object in making a
puncture by measurement is to avoid the diaphragm. Freteau,
of Nantes, says that he performed the operation on the
left side between the tenth and eleventh ribs, and on the right
side between the ninth and tenth in more than thirty dead
bodies, and always opened into the cavity of the chest, commencing
the incision close to the edge of the latissimus dorsi
muscle, or about three inches and a half from the spine&mdash;an
operation which in this place should be done by incision,
and not by the trocar. When there is reason to believe that
there is an extraneous body to be extracted, such as a ball,
the place of election is of importance, as it is desirable it
should be a little above the diaphragm in order to facilitate
its extraction; for although, by carefully shifting the position
of the patient, a ball or a piece of bone may be brought
to rest against the opening, it will not be easily taken hold
of unless it lie upon the diaphragm, a point which will be
hereafter further elucidated. When an external swelling indicates
the presence of matter, and there is reason to believe
it communicates with the inside of the chest, the opening
should be made into the tumor, and is then called the “operation
by necessity,” which is not an uncommon occurrence
after gunshot wounds. It is not, however, always done in
the most convenient place, and should then be repeated lower
down, which will also be sometimes necessary in consequence
of the matter collected in this way being cut off by adhesions
from the general cavity.</p>

<p>When the operation by incision alone was performed, the
success was certainly not great. In modern practice (after
the operation by puncture) it has been much greater, which
may be attributed to the operation having been had recourse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
to at an earlier period, or about the end of the third week.
After wounds penetrating the chest which do not admit the
effused fluid to flow out, it should be done much earlier.</p>

<p>It is possible that both sides of the chest may be affected;
but both sides may not be punctured in succession, for an
error in puncturing both, or even the sonorous or sound side
instead of the dull or affected side, has been almost immediately
destructive of life.</p>

<p>318. The admission of atmospheric air into the cavity of
the chest during this operation has been much deprecated,
and many inventions have been recommended for its prevention,
but it is scarcely possible to prevent some air getting
in. It is often seen to do so; it has been proved by auscultation
to have done so, and is usually absorbed in a few hours.
In one case which I saw it gave rise to distressing symptoms
from pressure on the lung, but was removed by a common
syringe, to the great relief of the patient. In all these
cases two things must be considered: Can the compressed
lung expand so as to fill the chest when the fluid is withdrawn?
The answer must be, in many cases it is so bound
down by adhesions that it can dilate but slowly, if at all.
If it be asked whether a vacuum is formed in the chest, the
answer will be, no; and it will then be admitted, on consideration,
that air always finds its way into the chest, and
never does harm to persons in health. When mischief does
ensue after an operation or an injury, it usually occurs from
the irritation caused in a particular state of constitution, and
not from the admission of air. A change in the appearance
of the discharge has been frequently found to follow, and to
depend upon, an accidental derangement of stomach, and
to return to its more normal state on the derangement being
removed. If the wound into a cavity can be closed and
healed, the air will remain with impunity until absorbed. If
the wound cannot be healed, unhealthy inflammation may be
propagated from it to the whole cavity with which it communicates,
but this is not the effect of the admitted air.</p>

<p>Dr. H. M. Hughes has published several cases of pneumothorax
in the first part of the of the volume of “Guy’s
Hospital Reports” for 1852. In the sixth case, which he
calls a genuine example of pneumothorax from rupture of
one or more of the vesicles of an emphysematous lung, the
patient died speedily; and, on examination, he says: “It
is also an interesting fact that no evidence of inflammatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
action existed in the pleura, as it indicates that air in a
healthy serous membrane does not excite inflammation;”&mdash;a
Peninsular dogma I have been forty years inculcating, and
which I trust is at last admitted as an established fact. How
long it may be before it is generally taught, is another matter;
for surgeons, like other men, often adhere with tenacity
to preconceived opinions, however erroneous, particularly as
they advance in life and have ceased to desire to learn more
than they already know.</p>

<p>319. In all cases of <i>serous</i> effusion, there can be little
doubt that the fluid should be wholly evacuated and the
wound closed. When the fluid is <i>purulent</i>, a permanent
drain should be early established. It is not, however, common
for the operation to be repeated several times without
the serous discharge becoming purulent; and, in such cases,
it usually becomes necessary at last to allow the wound to
remain open until the discharge shall cease of itself. Whenever
more than one opening is necessary, and the first is
made between the fifth and sixth ribs, the succeeding ones
should be made lower down; so that when it is thought
right to leave the last puncture to become fistulous, it may
be made as near the diaphragm as may be thought consistent
with the safety of that part.</p>

<p>When a doubt exists as to the probability of more than
one puncture being sufficient, and it seems likely that a third,
or even more, will be required, the surgeon may anticipate
this necessity by introducing a piece of soft gum-elastic
catheter through the canula into the chest to the extent of
about three inches, enough being left outside to admit of its
being secured by tapes and adhesive plaster; through this
a certain quantity of the fluid may be drawn off daily until
it ceases to be discharged. The elastic tube bends with the
heat, and applies itself to the inside of the ribs. If the
lung should rub against it, which can be ascertained by a
blunt probe, the elastic tube should be removed, and the
external wound kept open by a softer plug. In all these
operations, care should be taken to prevent the occurrence
of inflammation. The accession of pain in the part, of difficulty
of breathing, of fever, should be met by the abstraction
of a few ounces of blood by cupping, by dry-cupping,
by mercury in small doses, by rest, by diet, etc., and, if a
tube have been introduced, by its removal.</p>

<p>The propriety of injecting stimulating or even simple fluids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
into the cavity of the chest has been often advocated, and as
frequently repudiated. Warm water or milk and water is
certainly admissible, and has been found very useful, particularly
when there is an adventitious cause keeping up the irritation,
which may possibly be brought to the opening by the
sudden abstraction of the injection. Pieces of cloth and bits
of exfoliated bone have been floated out by throwing in an
injection of tepid milk and water. The opening, in a case
of this kind, should be made between the eleventh and twelfth
ribs behind.</p>

<p>Dr. Wendelstadt, of Hersfield, in the year 1810, in the
twenty-third year of his age, suffered an attack of pleurisy,
which became chronic, and ended in effusion. After severe
suffering for six months, he was able to attend to his professional
duties. The ribs of the right side protruded, but the
intercostal spaces did not; the whole side was motionless on
respiration taking place. The circumference of the chest
continued to increase, and fluctuation within became evident
on succussion. In June, 1819, having undergone another
attack of pleurisy, he submitted to the operation for empyema,
as offering some hope of preserving life. When a pint
of fluid had been discharged, the wound was closed, and he
experienced great relief. The next day a third of a quart
was taken away twice in the day, and on the third day as
much more; but he thought this was too much, as he became
greatly exhausted, and feared that suffocation was impending.
He was recovered by stimulants. On the fourth day
the fluid was thicker in consistence, and fetid, and continued
more or less so for a fortnight. It was then allowed to flow
as it would at each dressing. Astringent injections were
used for six weeks, but were then abandoned, and he gradually
recovered his strength. Thirteen years afterward, in
1830, the wound was still open, discharging twice a day,
sometimes only half a drachm, sometimes three or four ounces
daily. The right side had altogether shrunk, and did not
move on inspiration; he had no cough, and was otherwise
in good health; a piece of a rib became loose, and was removed
at the end of thirteen years, when the report of the
case terminated, the patient being in health.</p>

<p>It may be remarked on this case, that the admission of air
did no harm; that the lung remained compressed; that the
whole side thickened and flattened, as a consequence, so as
to obliterate the cavity; but the cure would not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
effected even then, if the piece of carious rib had not been
discovered and removed.</p>

<p>Mr. Winter, secretary to Admiral Sir C. Napier, was
wounded by two musket-balls, one in the arm, while the other
entered between the inferior edge of the left scapula and the
thorax, which it penetrated, fracturing a rib in its progress,
and lodged. He fell, and spat up some blood, and as symptoms
of inflammation supervened in twenty-four hours, he
was bled largely; this was repeated frequently until these
symptoms were subdued. He was after a time sent to the
Marine Hospital, Lisbon, in a miserable plight, suffering
from hectic fever, with a flushed face, hot skin, glassy eye,
great prostration of strength, cough, restlessness, dyspnœa,
and copious night-sweats. The wound discharged a watery,
sanious, fetid matter in quantity, and he was unable to do
anything but eat, and for food he had a great craving. From
this state, under good treatment, he gradually recovered his
strength, and on the 18th of June, 1834, a piece of the rib
was removed. The wound remained open with a great purulent
discharge, which kept him in a reduced state; a little
more than one year after the injury, he reached London, and
was taken into the Westminster Hospital. The left side of
the chest was flattened and contracted, and the lung was
doing very little in the respiratory way; the wound discharging
a quantity of matter, which he could readily evacuate by
making the opening the dependent point, but not otherwise.
On enlarging the external wound, so as to make the opening
into the chest direct, I found a round-pointed gum-elastic
bougie could pass into it for four inches, and, on bending it
down, for six inches more, it having to pass over a thickened
pleura, and false membrane of an almost cartilaginous nature,
for the extent of an inch, before it could be felt to be in a
large cavity. As it did not appear that he had any chance
of recovery, unless another opening were made lower than
the sixth rib, in a more dependent position, I proposed the
operation, but he would not submit; and after a time he left
the hospital and went into the country, where he died.</p>

<p>A non-commissioned officer, of the 2d Division of cavalry,
was wounded at the battle of Albuhera, on the 10th of July,
1811, in several places, by the lances of the Polish cavalry;
one of these penetrated the left side of the chest behind, immediately
below and in front of the inferior angle of the
scapula. He spat and coughed up blood, and lost so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
from the wound that he became insensible, the bleeding having
been stopped by a part of his shirt being bound upon it
tightly by means of his woolen sash. Brought to the village
of Valverde, my attention was drawn to him some days afterward,
in consequence of the difficulty of breathing having
increased so that he was obliged to be raised nearly to an
upright position, as well as from his inability to rest on the
part wounded, round which a dark-blue inflammatory swelling
had taken place, the wound having closed. An incision
being made into it, a quantity of bloody purulent matter
and clots of blood flowed from it. The incision was then enlarged,
so as to allow of a direct opening into the cavity of
the chest, which was kept open. The relief was immediate.
He was removed to Elvas, apparently doing well, some three
weeks afterward.</p>

<p>This case offered the nearest approach I have seen to the
ecchymosed edema described by Valentin as accompanying
effusions of blood into the cavity of the chest; and, as well
as the following, is an instance of operations, not by election,
but by necessity.</p>

<p>A French soldier had been wounded at Almaraz by a
musket-ball, which went through the right side of the chest,
in a line nearly horizontal from a little below and to the outside
of the nipple, backward. The first symptoms having
subsided, he gradually descended the Tagus to Lisbon, where,
after some months of continual discharge, the wounds closed,
first the back, and then the front. He did not recover his
strength, always looking sickly, and suffering from pain, difficulty
of breathing, and other inconveniences, which did not
prevent his walking about in the confined space to which he
was doomed as a prisoner of war. My attention was drawn
to him in consequence of an obvious fullness of the intercostal
spaces, of the great difficulty of breathing, and of a puffy
inflammatory swelling which was forming around and at the
seat of the wound in front. Through this I made an incision
into the cavity of the chest, the walls of which, on introducing
the finger through the opening, appeared to be very
much thicker than usual. A large quantity of pus was discharged,
and the man was relieved, but this amelioration was
not of long continuance, and he gradually sank and died.
On opening the body, the inside of the wall of the chest was
found to be half an inch in thickness, in consequence of a
firm deposition on the pleura, of a yellowish-ash color, honey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>-combed
or ulcerated, as it were, in plates, particularly where
the opening had been made. The lung was shrunk up from
the anterior and lower part of the chest, but adhered to the
wounded part behind, and was covered by a layer of false
membrane of considerable thickness. The wound through
the lung could not be distinctly traced, from its being diseased
throughout.</p>

<p>At Santander, in October of the same year, 1813, I received
some eight hundred wounded in the affairs of Le Saca,
Vera, etc. One of the Light Division had been shot through
the left side of the chest: the posterior wound had closed,
but a sufficiently large quantity of matter was discharged
through a small anterior one to show that there must be
some depot from which it proceeded. The wound was laid
open into the cavity of the chest, and free vent given to a
quantity of matter. Some small pieces of rib were discharged,
and a bit of something like the cloth of his coat also came
away. He could lie on either side, and hopes were entertained
of his recovery, until after I left Santander in December,
to join the army in France, when he suffered a relapse
of inflammation, and died.</p>

<p>A soldier of the German Legion was wounded at Waterloo
by a lance between the sixth and seventh ribs of the left
side. He spat up much blood for several days, and was carried
to Antwerp, where he remained for several months, suffering
from great difficulty of breathing and other distress in
his chest, which recurred from time to time, although the
wound had healed. He was admitted into the York Hospital,
Chelsea, in the spring of 1816, in consequence of an
attack of inflammation, of which he died. On examining the
body, the lung of the right side was found to be greatly inflamed,
and full of purulent fluid, which caused his death.
The left or wounded side was found to contain a small quantity
of pus, the cavity being very much diminished by the
great thickening of the pleura and the falling in of the ribs,
which were thicker, greatly flattened, and changed in form;
the lung, shrunk or collapsed, was covered by a thick adventitious
membrane, and bound down against the spine, leaving
a long, small space between the pleuræ, which once had
doubtlessly been full of matter. The mediastinum and heart
appeared to lean toward the left side, aiding in this manner
in the obliteration of the cavity, which must take place if a
permanent cure be effected in empyema. I have seen two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
cases in which this obliteration appeared to be complete:
one in a soldier, who had been wounded in the chest; the
other in a gentleman, the subject of empyema, in private
life. In both the spine was also distorted, the side wasted,
the nipple lower than the other. The breathing of the opposite
side was more marked and developed. It might have
been called puerile.</p>

<p>320. <i>Pneumothorax</i> means an effusion of air and of the
matter of a tubercular abscess from disease into the cavity of
the chest, or from an injury or a wound in the lung. When
pneumothorax is the consequence of disease of long standing,
the patient may be sensible of a sudden pain, which does
not abate, and which is accompanied by an equally sudden
increase of the difficulty of breathing, for which he cannot
account. He feels relief by lying on his back or on the
affected side, rarely on the other, although the difficulty of
breathing may increase, so as to render the further continuance
of life doubtful, while the prostration of strength is
considerable. The muscles of respiration are all in rapid
and powerful action; the heart is displaced to the right side
when the complaint attacks the left, and it will be displaced
somewhat to the left when the right is affected; in some
cases it even descends into the epigastrium, or is otherwise
removed from its natural situation, even toward the axilla,
although the left side is supposed to be more obnoxious to
this complaint than the right. The pulse becomes exceedingly
quick and small, countenance pale, nights sleepless.
The affected side is oftentimes evidently dilated, and the intercostal
spaces may be less marked, or partly filled up, when
the respiratory motion given to the parts under ordinary circumstances
is seen to be deficient. But these differences, as
well as that which can be obtained by comparing both sides
by measurement, are not so marked as when the cavity is
filled with fluid, of which in pneumothorax there is always
a small quantity effused.</p>

<p><i>Percussion</i>, beginning from above, in the erect position,
will give, in cases in which it is ascertained that respiration
is null, a clear tympanitic sound, as low as the level of the
fluid, when it changes abruptly to a dull sound, or that indicating
the presence thereof. If the patient be then placed
in the recumbent position, the clear sound can be heard
above, the dull one below, demonstrating the change in the
situation of the air and fluid. <i>Auscultation</i>, in addition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
the absence of respiration, when the chest is fully expanded,
discovers no respiratory murmur; but a peculiar sound called
<i>tintement métallique</i>, or metallic tinkling, is heard at intervals,
particularly on the patient’s coughing, speaking, or
breathing. It may be imitated by dropping a pin into a
large wine-glass, but it more nearly resembles the sound of
a jew’s-harp in the hands of a child: once heard it cannot be
mistaken. It is a sound distinctive of pneumothorax.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cornish, a medical practitioner, having suffered an
attack of pleuritis, nearly expired from suffocation on Monday,
the 29th December, 1828. He was lying on his right
side, breathing most laboriously; countenance sunk; pulse
between 130 and 140; had had no sleep for many nights.
The action of all the respiratory muscles was painful to behold;
no perceptible difference in the size or shape of the
two sides. The <i>right</i> emitted an extremely dull sound; the
<i>left</i> sounded hollow throughout. The apex of the heart
was beating rather to the right of the right nipple. The
respiration was loud and rattling in the <i>right</i> side; metallic
tinkling distinct in the <i>left</i>; expectoration muco-purulent,
with specks of blood, and many black particles. Mr. Guthrie,
who saw him for the first time, made a short incision between
the sixth and seventh ribs, and cautiously opened the pleura,
when a rush of air issued forth with a hissing noise, strong
enough to have extinguished several candles. The patient
turned on his back, breathed with comparative freedom, and
expressed his gratitude for the operation. No fluid issued
from the wound when made a dependent opening. On the
31st, the difficulty of breathing and the metallic tinkling had
returned, the wound having closed. The wound was reopened
and enlarged; the pulse fell to 120; the metallic
tinkling ceased to be heard; the patient took some nourishment
and an opiate at night.</p>

<p>“Jan. 1st, 1829.&mdash;Has slept several hours; breathing
easy; pulse reduced in frequency; appetite good. A canula
was placed in the wound, when large quantities of air came
through it on each expiration; the heart beat two inches
nearer the central line of the thorax than before. During
the night he became greatly oppressed, and died next day.
On raising the sternum, the heart was found rather to the
right of the median line of the chest. The left lung was
collapsed to one-fifth of its natural dimensions. The vacant
space was filled with air, and about fourteen ounces of turbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
serous fluid. The pleuræ costalis and pulmonalis presented
marks of inflammation of a few weeks’ standing&mdash;viz., some
thin false membranes, which were easily separated by scraping
with the scalpel. There were no marks of more recent
pleurisy. A tube was inserted into the trachea, and air
blown into the lungs. The left lung expanded to a certain
extent, and air was heard to bubble out, when an aperture
was immediately recognized at the division between the two
lobes, through which the air rushed forth and extinguished
a taper that was held near it. The aperture was circular,
fistulous, and capable of admitting a crow-quill, and was
found to communicate with a very small excavation, formed
by the softening down of some tuberculous matter; into this
small excavation a bronchial tube was seen to enter. Thus,
the communication between the trachea and the cavity of the
chest was distinctly traced. The left lung presented some
trifling tuberculation, but was not materially diseased.”</p>

<p>William Griffin, aged eighteen, was admitted into the
Westminster Hospital on September 14th. Ten days before
his admission into the hospital he discharged a pistol against
the left side of his chest, causing a wound corresponding to
the middle of the eighth rib, from which a very small quantity
of blood escaped. The medical practitioner who was
called to him at the time <i>passed a probe to the extent of
four inches</i> into the wound. The wound had nearly cicatrized,
but he became the subject of acute pain, diffused over
the whole of the left side of the chest, accompanied by fever
and frequent cough, dyspnœa, and inability of lying on the
right side. After the lapse of a week he was transferred by
his surgeon to the medical wards under Dr. Roe, at which
time he had begun to expectorate purulent matter of an extremely
fetid character, occasionally mixed with blood. His
respiration was hurried, the right side of the chest expanding
much more freely than the left; the lower three-fourths
of the affected side were dull on percussion; tubular respiration
could be detected at the upper part, but at the lower
no air appeared to enter; well-marked modifications of voice
existed over the whole of that side of the chest. By measurement
no difference in the relative size of the chest was observed,
but the intercostal spaces of the left side remained
motionless daring expiration. The heart could be felt feebly
pulsating at the epigastrium.</p>

<p>October 15th.&mdash;He suffered from a violent paroxysm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
coughing, during which great dyspnœa suddenly came on.
He sat propped up in bed; respiration was almost ineffectual,
his face livid and covered by a cold, clammy sweat, pulse
scarcely perceptible at the wrist, and his extremities were
becoming cold. On examining the chest, the left side, before
quite dull, now afforded tympanitic resonance on percussion,
which, together with the total loss of respiration and the
presence of metallic tinkling, proved the existence of pneumothorax.
A trocar was introduced between the sixth and
seventh ribs, and was followed by an escape of gas with
about five drachms of pus, both of a very fetid character;
the canula becoming obstructed, a larger one was then passed
through the opening, but not more than half an ounce of pus
escaped; it was then withdrawn, and found to be blocked
up by what appeared to be disintegrated lung. Being greatly
relieved, no further attempts at evacuating the fluid were
then made.</p>

<p>At night, during a paroxysm of coughing, six ounces of
fetid pus escaped by the opening, after which he felt relieved.
A second gush of sanious fluid, to the amount of
five ounces, containing small masses of sloughing membrane,
subsequently took place. Cavernous respiration at the upper
half of the lung, mixed with gurgling and metallic tinkling.
Expectoration muco-purulent and offensive.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;Has somewhat improved, but suffers from accessions
of fever toward evening, and perspires very profusely
during the night; the cough is less frequent, and he expectorates
freely, the sputa being of a purulent, fetid character.
Scarcely any discharge from the side.</p>

<p>Nov. 5th.&mdash;Has remained in nearly the same condition
until yesterday, when he ceased to expectorate, and has
since become much worse; his skin is now intensely hot;
face flushed; tongue brown and coated; pulse jerking, but
feeble and frequent; the opening in the chest has quite
healed.</p>

<p>A second opening was now made about an inch external
to the former one, and a canula introduced, but not more
than one ounce of pus escaped, the instrument becoming
blocked up by portions of sloughing tissue; during a paroxysm
of coughing, which occurred a few hours afterward,
several ounces of fetid sanguineous pus were forced through
the wound.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Since the last report he has been slowly sinking&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
is emaciated to an extreme degree. The wound originally
produced by the pistol-ball, as well as those made by the
trocar, have become fistulous, so that during respiration the
air passes into the chest, and is expelled with as much freedom
as that passing by the trocar. Expectoration has continued
very copious, about a pint and a half having been
passed in every twelve hours; large sloughs have formed
upon the nates and hips, his intellect wanders, and he has
frequent syncope. Died on the 5th of December.</p>

<p><i>Sectio cadaveris.</i>&mdash;The pleural cavity of the left side
contained about ten ounces of purulent matter mixed with
blood, and floating in it were numerous masses of white,
curd-like matter, at the bottom of which, in the angle formed
by the diaphragm with the spine, was found a pistol-ball
partly covered by albuminous matter and discolored. Fluid
injected into the left bronchus was found to issue freely from
an opening at the most depending part of the lung, communicating
with a small cavity,
the interior of which was
lined by the same thick membrane
met with in cases of
chronic phthisical disease;
from the upper part of this
cavity two other sinuses were
formed, the one passing externally
and terminating by
an adhesion of the lung with
the ribs at the point where
the ball had entered; the
other was longer and more
tortuous, passing deeply in
the substance of the lung,
and ending in a large abscess
capable of containing five or
six ounces of pus. The lung
was at its lower part firmly
attached to the ribs by intervening
false membrane, while
the upper part was free, and
had become compressed toward
the spinal column. The
substance of that part of the
lung not involved in the abscess was infiltrated with pus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the greater number of the bronchial tubes were filled up by
masses of curdy matter similar to those found floating in the
effused fluid. The natural division of the lung into lobes
was quite destroyed by the pleuritic adhesions of one to the
other, while the pleura lining the parietes was covered by
rugged layers of false membrane of irregular thickness, but
readily detached. No trace of tubercular deposit could be
found, and the lung of the opposite side was quite healthy.
Since the first publication of these cases the operation has
been so frequently and, in many instances, so successfully
performed, as to leave no doubt of the advantages to be
derived from it.</p>

<p>321. Lord Beaumont was wounded by a pistol-ball on
the 13th of February, 1832, when standing sideways. It
entered the right side of the chest a little below the nipple,
appeared to pass under the lower end of the sternum, just
above or about the xyphoid cartilage, and to have lodged in
the cartilage of the last of the true ribs of the left side near
its junction with the bone, in consequence of a round projection
at that part resembling a pistol-ball, but which, on
being exposed, showed only a knob of cartilage which
might have been a natural formation; no further steps were
therefore taken. The injury had been received about four
o’clock&mdash;it was now five; he could lay flat on his back; had
little or no pain or oppression.&mdash;Seven o’clock: Breathing
became oppressed, and accompanied by pain; vesicular murmur
distinct in both lungs; pulse 96; bleeding to thirty-two
ounces.&mdash;Nine o’clock: Difficulty of breathing; the pain
greater; was again bled until the pulse failed, although he
did not faint; the relief great.&mdash;Half-past ten: Oppressive
breathing again returned; pulse very low and quick; thirty-six
leeches applied; relief obtained.&mdash;Half-past twelve:
Thirty-six more leeches.&mdash;Half-past two: Thirty leeches
were again applied. In all, four pints of blood were taken
from the arm, and one hundred and two leeches were applied
to the chest, the bleeding being encouraged afterward; during
the first ten hours live grains of calomel and four of the
compound extract of colocynth had been given, and now
forty minims of Battley’s solution of opium were administered.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;Eight o’clock: Slept after four o’clock; on waking
took an aperient draught, and is much easier; pulse 120,
soft, small, and weak.&mdash;Three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: On the dyspnœa return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>ing
twenty-one leeches were applied, and the oppression was
relieved; an enema given, which acted freely.&mdash;Half-past
twelve: A returning oppression relieved by eleven leeches;
calomel repeated, and thirty minims of solution of opium.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Slept at intervals; little or no expectoration,
no blood; thinks he would faint if he sat up in
bed; pulse 130, soft, small, and weak; little pain; lies tolerably
flat; respiratory murmur distinct on both sides.&mdash;Nine
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: Oppression returned; twenty-four leeches; repeat calomel
and colocynth; an enema, after which the bowels became
free.&mdash;Evening: Six grains of calomel, and opium
draught.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Had forty-eight leeches applied at
intervals twice during the night; slept at intervals, and is
easier; no pain in the chest; pulse 108.&mdash;Evening: An
enema; six grains of calomel, and one grain of opium.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Slept during the night, and is better;
pulse 108, soft; breathes freely; no pain.&mdash;Evening: Has
had leeches applied twice during the day, making in all 245,
and each time with relief; an enema,&mdash;calomel and opium
as before.&mdash;Twelve at night: More oppression, and, as the
pulse was fuller and quicker, a vein in the arm was opened,
but only four ounces of blood could be obtained.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Slept at intervals, although very restless;
pulse 120, fuller; oppression in breathing returning;
bleeding to twenty ounces, which caused him to faint; senna
draught.&mdash;Evening: Has been much relieved by the bleeding;
blood cupped and buffy; twenty leeches; enema;
calomel and opium. In the night, at two o’clock, the dyspnœa
returning, twenty-two leeches were applied, and thirty
minims of solution of opium given.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Easier, quieter, better; pulse 110,
soft; can lie quite flat on his back. The wound discharged
so little that the external parts were dilated inward toward
the sternum, until the pulsation of an artery could be seen,
perhaps the internal mammary, which it was not thought
advisable to disturb; respiratory murmur not distinct at
night; enema; calomel, opium, and twenty leeches.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;At three in the morning, being greatly oppressed,
thirty leeches were applied, and at eight o’clock twenty more,
which quite relieved him, but left him in a state of great exhaustion,
sick, and faint. A little arrow-root relieved the
faintness; discharge from the wound free, and accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
by <i>air</i>; bowels open.&mdash;Ten at night: Calomel, and forty
minims of the solution of opium.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Has now, for the first time, a hope of
life: pulse 112, soft; no pain; can turn on his side, but
fears to hurt himself; wound discharges freely; has had a
small piece of bread for the first time.&mdash;Four <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: Restless,
but better; senna and sulphate of magnesia mixture.&mdash;Eight
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: Oppressed; pulse 120; twelve leeches; calomel,
and thirty minims of the solution of opium, at night.</p>

<p>23d.&mdash;Oppression at night relieved by six leeches; slept
afterward; breath slightly affected by the mercury, which
was omitted in consequence; ten grains of the compound
extract of colocynth given at night, with thirty minims of
the solution of opium.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Free from pain; breathes easily and without difficulty;
can turn in bed with ease; slept well; the discharge
from the wound is free; takes farinaceous food,
oranges, tea, etc. He gradually improved until the 13th
of March.&mdash;On the previous Friday, the 9th, he removed
from Bond Street to Mount Street; and on the 13th, amused
himself by washing all over in a small back room without a
fire; caught cold, and acquired a troublesome cough, which
was quieted on the 14th, at night, by opium.&mdash;On the 15th,
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, it was evident that some mischief had been done; pulse
120; breathing difficult; was bedewed with a cold sweat;
respiratory murmur indistinct on both sides; on the left, not
heard below the fourth rib; although the whole side sounded
sonorously, it evidently contained air, the <i>tintement métallique</i>
being very remarkable. The wound having closed
very much, and the distance to the left cavity of the pleura
under the sternum being considerable, a piece of sponge tied
around the eye of a small gum-elastic catheter was introduced,
so as to enlarge the track of the ball, and give passage
to the air from the left side of the chest. This was
done at five o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and at ten, on its being withdrawn,
air rushed out in a very manifest manner, to his great relief.
The metallic tinkling, which was distinct before the instrument
was withdrawn, instantly ceased, but could be reproduced
by closing the opening. The small gum catheter was
therefore reintroduced with the eye projecting beyond the
sponge, and retained, air passing through it; cough very
troublesome.</p>

<p>March 17th.&mdash;Better; pulse 100; bowels open; cough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
easier; expectorates freely a <i>rouillée</i>, or reddish muco-purulent
matter.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Easier and better; breathing on the left side not
heard below the fourth rib; discharge free; the permanent
gum catheter taken out, but passed in daily. After this he
slowly recovered, and continued to enjoy good health until
the summer of 1854, when he died of what was supposed to
be ulceration of the stomach, being an admirable instance of
the treatment to be followed in such cases. When there is
not an opening to enlarge, one should be made with the
trocar.</p>

<p>It has been stated by the latest writers on pneumothorax,
that tympanitic resonance on percussion, and the absence of
respiration, are not pathognomonic signs of pneumothorax,
as these physical signs may exist without it, and pneumothorax
may exist without them. The metallic tinkling, in
addition to the absence of all appearance of disease in the
abdomen, will be conclusive of the presence of this disease.</p>

<p>322. Emphysema, from εν and φυσαω, to inflate; the diffusion
of air into a part of or throughout the cellular tissue
of the body. It has been said to take place after a wound
of the chest, but without an injury of the lung, from the air
passing through the wound into the cavity during inspiration;
and by accumulation and subsequent compression
under the act of expiration, giving rise to all the symptoms
of the disease; a complaint more theoretical than real.</p>

<p>Emphysema, as a medical disease, is opposed to the surgical
disease, in not being an extravasation of air into the
cavity of the chest, but a dilatation of the air-cells formed
for its reception. It is of two kinds, <i>Vesicular</i> and <i>Interlobular</i>&mdash;vesicular
when dependent on the enlargement of
one or more air-cells; interlobular when, from the sudden
rupture of an air-cell, the air has found its way into the interlobular
structure of the lung. A third and very rare
kind has been added, in which air, being extravasated under
the pleura, has raised it in the form of a pouch. The morbid
appearances these diseases afford, and the symptoms they
give rise to, do not fall within the range of surgical skill;
and are not frequently within the controlling power of
medical science and ability.</p>

<p>Emphysema is free from redness, and is distinguished from
edema, or the swelling containing a serous fluid which is
also colorless, by its not pitting on pressure, or retaining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
mark of the finger. It is, on the contrary, elastic; and the
displacement of the air, on pressing on the part, gives rise
to a peculiar noise, resembling the crackling of a dry bladder
partly filled with air on its being compressed, usually called
crepitation. This swelling extends as the air introduced
increases in quantity until the whole of the areolar tissue of
the body may be fully distended.</p>

<p>Emphysema most commonly occurs from fractured ribs, a
point from one or more of which abrades the surface of the
lung. Through the opening thus made, the air escapes into
the sac of the pleura, and thence by the side of the broken
part of the ribs into the cellular membrane. The distress in
breathing arises from the air being diffused over the surface
of the lung, which it gradually causes to collapse under the
pressure exercised by the act of expiration; while, at the
same time, the mediastinum yielding, the opposite lung suffers
in a similar way, although to a less extent, until the
aerification of the blood is so greatly obstructed as at last
to interfere with life, unless relief be obtained by the equalization
of the pressure made on the lung by the compressed
air in the cavity of the pleura, with that exercised on the
inside of the lung through the glottis.</p>

<p>In ordinary but not severe cases of fractured ribs, a
slight degree of emphysema is frequently observed over the
injured part, implying that the lung has been wounded;
such a case requires the application of a compress, wetted
with a little spirit and cold water, retained by a bandage.
The great art in the treatment of broken ribs by compress
and bandage consists in their proper application, which can
only be ascertained by the feelings of the patient. The application
of a broad flannel bandage, so as to restrain the
motions of the chest, and to cause the sufferer to breathe by
the diaphragm, has been recommended from the earliest
periods of surgery; but many persons with injured or broken
ribs cannot bear the pressure of a bandage, while others
derive much ease from its use. A tight bandage generally
disagrees when the injury has been sustained at the lower
part of the chest, and is more frequently useful when the
fracture is above the fifth or sixth rib.</p>

<p>When the emphysematous swelling extends so as to invade
a considerable portion of the body, the further diffusion
of air should be prevented by punctures made through the
skin in such places as may be thought necessary, and in ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>treme
cases even by incisions; but these are things more
often spoken of and written about than practiced, or than
are even necessary.</p>

<p>323. Mr. J. Bell had so alarmed all military surgeons by
stating, in his able discourses on the Nature and Cure of
Wounds, that emphysema was “peculiarly frequent in gunshot
wounds of the chest, both at the orifice of entrance and
of exit of the ball,” that they thought of little else. They
could not withstand the brilliant manner in which this remarkable
error&mdash;for error it is&mdash;was expressed. To such of
us as had served in the first part of the war in Portugal it was
no longer a bugbear; we slept in peace after the battles of
Roliça and Vimiera, of Corunna, of Oporto, and Talavera&mdash;laughing,
perhaps, a little at the credulity of the surgical
portion of mankind; for the opening made by a musket-ball
rarely admits of emphysema. A slanting wound made by a
pistol-ball may sometimes give rise to it. After long and
tortuous wounds made by swords or lances it is seen more
frequently, but then it takes place shortly after the receipt
of the injury.</p>

<p>A soldier, at the battle of Albuhera, was wounded in the
right side of the chest by a sword, which had passed slantingly
under the shoulder-blade, from which injury he did not
suffer much, until the whole side as well as the body and
neck began to swell and impede his breathing, which was
effected with some difficulty and with any ease only when
sitting up. The external wound was enlarged until I could
distinctly hear the air rush out and see the part where the
weapon had penetrated between the ribs; upon which he
declared himself relieved, when the wound was closed by
compress and bandage. It did not unite, however; active
inflammation of the cavity of the chest ensued, requiring
frequent and considerable losses of blood for its suppression.
At the end of three weeks the man was sent to Elvas, in a
favorable state for recovery.</p>

<p>324. When an opening is made into the cavity of the
chest in the dead body, the lung recedes from the pleura
lining its wall, for some distance; it is said to collapse; but
this does not take place in anything like the same extent
in the living body; and if the continued admission of air
through the wound be prevented, it scarcely takes place at
all; or, should it have done so, the air is usually absorbed
and the lung quickly recovers its natural dimensions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
functions. Neither does a wound in the chest, when kept
open, usually cause this collapse to the extent which it is
generally supposed to do in the living body. The lung can
be seen in motion and performing its office, although imperfectly,
as it does not fill the cavity of the pleura. When the
lung has been wounded by a ball actually going through its
substance, it does not necessarily collapse; and abrasions
or deeper injuries of its surface lead to no such result. To
cause the complete collapse of a living lung, its surface
must be compressed by a fluid, as in empyema, or by confined
air, as in emphysema or in pneumothorax.</p>

<p>In extreme cases, when the patient can no longer lie down,
but sits up, supported, in the greatest agony of respiration,
approaching to suffocation, the face and lips swollen and
blue, the pulse almost imperceptible and countless, an opening
should be made into the chest by a small trocar and
canula, for the purpose of evacuating the highly compressed
and compressing air, and to allow the expansion of the lung
after its evacuation. When this compressed air has been
drawn off, as in the case of Lord Beaumont, the compressing
power being removed, the lung expands in part, if not entirely,
in spite of the breach in it, and the mediastinum and
heart return to their natural situation, the distress in breathing
is removed, the failing circulation is restored, and the
opposite lung resumes its functions.</p>

<p>The course then to pursue in such extreme cases is merely
to puncture the chest, evacuate the air, withdraw the canula,
and close the opening. The life of the patient having been
thus saved, time is given for the wound in the lung to heal
under the usual inflammatory processes, provided it will do
so without a recurrence of the mischief. This, if it should
take place, must be met by another puncture, or the opening
in the chest should be made permanent in order to equalize
the pressure of the air in the cavity.</p>

<p>The incisions (the “<i>taillades</i>” of the French) into the
cavity of the chest formerly recommended, should only be
resorted to when the means indicated have failed, which they
will rarely do when combined in the first instance with an
antiphlogistic treatment, aided by sedatives, and if necessary
by cordials.</p>

<p>The advantages to be derived from auscultation in these
cases are evident. Its value has been sufficiently shown, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the ear or the stethoscope should be resorted to at least
three times in every twenty-four hours, in every case, however
trifling it may appear to be, until the absence of danger
has been ascertained.</p>

<p class="h2sub">SIMPLE INJURIES OF THE CHEST, ETC.</p>

<p>325. The most <i>simple injury</i>, perforating the wall of
the chest, is a stab by a triangular sword, a small knife, or
other weapon, which may or may not abrade the surface of
the lung, and which is usually attended by little pain,
although it often gives rise to considerable alarm. It might
be supposed that a very slight wound of the lung would be
followed by some expectoration of blood, but this does not
always take place; and although its presence may be considered
demonstrative of the injury, its absence is no proof
of the contrary; for a considerable injury from a stab or
from a musket-ball may be inflicted, with scarcely any sign
of blood in the matter expectorated. If the pleuræ are in
their natural state, a small quantity of air may enter the
chest, but the opening will require to be direct and tolerably
large before the lung will separate or shrink from the wall
on that account; if adhesions should have been previously
formed between the pleuræ preventing it, they will be for the
advantage of the sufferer.</p>

<p>In a simple incised wound, injuring the lung perhaps extensively,
as supposed from the bleeding from the mouth, no
examination by probes or other instruments need or ought
to be made as a general rule; but the wound should be immediately
closed by sutures after the external parts have
been sufficiently examined to satisfy the surgeon that no
portion of the offending instrument has been broken off, or
other extraneous matters are sticking in the part.</p>

<p>The advantages derived from the closure of punctured
wounds of the chest in former times led to the practice of
sucking them by the mouths of irregular practitioners, generally
the drum-major of the regiment, when the patient
was a soldier; and the consequences, although in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
instances apparently miraculous, were in others quite as
unfortunate.</p>

<p>That bleeding may take place from the lung into the
cavity of the chest is indisputable, but little or no blood will
escape through a small wound; and its continuing to flow
from such a wound will be a presumptive if not a conclusive
proof that some artery external to the pleura has been
wounded. Sucking, under ordinary circumstances, of a
small wound, unattended by bleeding, does good by attracting
the natural fluids to the parts, and thus causing them to
swell so as to be placed in apposition in the most advantageous
manner for their reunion. Punctured wounds of small
size, therefore, may be sucked chirurgically if any one be
willing to do it, after which a bit of gold-beater’s skin, or
dry lint, should be placed upon the wound, supported by a
compress covered by adhesive plaster; these dressings should
not be removed for several days.</p>

<p>326. The patient should lie on the wounded part, as a
general rule, if he can conveniently bear it, not for the purpose
of allowing any effused blood or fluid to flow out, unless
some particular reason require the precaution of keeping
the wound open, but to allow the pleura covering the
lung to be as closely applied as may be to the pleura lining
the wall of the chest, with the hope that the adhesive process
may take place between these parts, and by this means
cut off the wound from the general cavity of the pleura, a
proceeding due to the practice of the Peninsular war, yet so
little attended to at the present time by some teachers of surgery,
who seem to confound the practice thus recommended
in incised wounds penetrating the cavity of the chest with
that which should be adopted in gunshot wounds, that few
students obtain even a reasonable degree of knowledge on
this subject. Teachers are entitled to prefer any mode of
treatment they please, but they should be careful not to
neglect the opinions of others, whose authority, derived from
experience, they are bound at least to notice, even if it
should be to disapprove.</p>

<p>327. <i>Incised</i> wounds of even greater extent ought not to
be examined by the probe or finger; no disturbance of any
kind should be permitted unless the cartilage or bone be injured.
The external parts should be brought together as
closely as possible, so as to facilitate in every way their
union, and the processes which it is desirable should go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
within. The external parts or skin and cellular membrane
cannot be kept in perfect and continued apposition without
sutures, and the proper method of proceeding is to sew up
the wound in the skin with a needle and fine silken thread
in a continuous manner, including absolutely nothing but so
much of the cut edges as will retain the thread; a small
piece of gold-beater’s skin or lint should then be laid over
the stitches and retained by a compress and adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>In a <i>simple</i> case of this kind little or nothing is effused
into the cavity or secreted from the membranes of the chest,
which will interfere with the processes which may have happily
begun, and which it is desirable should be aided by the
absolute quiescence of the patient, to whom no medicine
should be given which may render any movement of the
body necessary. It was formerly supposed that the greatest
object to be attained was the prevention of inflammation,
and a man was no sooner stabbed by his opponent than he
was blooded and purged by his surgeon, regardless of the
necessity which existed for perfect rest and the presence of
a certain amount of inflammation, in order to enable nature
to carry on those processes which are essential for the restoration
of the injured parts. This inflammation should be
allowed to commence without interference and to continue
in a moderate degree until the object shall have been effected.
It should only be interrupted or subdued when it is supposed
to be about to exceed that degree which experience has
pointed out as likely to be useful.</p>

<p>328. When the most courageous persons are wounded in
parts essential to life, there is more or less alarm or shock
created by the injury; although it has been gravely argued
that a man does not always know when he is actually shot
or run through the body. A continued state of anxiety and
depression after an accident of this kind is a disagreeable
accompaniment of the injury, during which little should be
done beyond the giving a little cordial, and quieting the
apprehensions of the patient, leaving him to rest, if possible,
after the necessary applications have been made. If a
gradual improvement take place, if the pulse rise, if the
patient resume more of his natural appearance, and that
state of commencing excitement which is denominated reaction
follow, hope may then be entertained. The general
symptoms, as long as they continue within ordinary bounds,
are of little importance; the local ones, significative of action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
commencing in the injured part, are, however, to be carefully
watched. They are those of inflammation of the pleura, and
it may be of the lung. This inflammation begins slowly, and
a day may elapse before it is well marked; for, when persons
have died within the first few hours after such injuries,
the pleura has often shown but little sign of inflammatory
action. Auscultation should always be resorted to from the
moment of injury, and constantly used throughout the treatment.
Whenever it is concluded that adhesion between the
two pleuræ has failed to take place, the direction to lie on
the wounded side ceases to be of importance. Until this
period no food whatever should be allowed, and thirst should
be allayed by small quantities of water.</p>

<p>329. A punctured, incised, or gunshot wound, going fairly
through both cavities of the chest, is usually believed to be
quickly if not immediately mortal&mdash;an opinion generally correct
with respect to wounds made by musket-balls, although
it is certainly not the case with regard to punctured wounds,
and does not always occur in those made by pistol or musket-balls.</p>

<p>Sergeant-Major Richards, of the 29th Regiment, received
thirteen sword or bayonet wounds, and other injuries, on the
heights of Roliça, on the 17th August, 1808&mdash;one particularly
through each side of the chest, between the ribs, as if
the small-sword had made a wound of larger size than usual.
He had distinguished himself greatly in covering the body
of his commanding officer, and was beaten down before the
British column, which had been repulsed, could rally and
recover its ground. He was an object of particular attention
to me, for the few minutes he lived after I saw him; he
had coughed up a little blood, and died gasping, as if suffocated,
the chest laboring on each side to do its work in vain.
His commanding officer, Colonel the Hon. George Lake, lay
dead by his side, killed instantaneously by a musket-ball,
which passed from the upper part of the left through the
right side of the chest.</p>

<p>A French gentleman, fencing with his pupil in July, 1834,
received a blow under the right axilla in a very violent lunge,
whereby the button of the foil was broken off, and the foil
itself passed into and through the back part of the thorax,
the point coming out between the sixth and seventh ribs on
the left side near the angles. There was but little bleeding.
The chief symptoms were those of great inflammation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
contents of the cavity, which gave way to full and repeated
bleeding from the arm, with perfect rest and almost starvation.
He recovered very favorably, and was quite well in
about eight weeks. He remains well, and is following his
profession as a teacher of fencing.</p>

<p>330. When an incised wound into the chest is large and
direct, injuring the lung, two very important points usually
demand immediate attention. The first is to relieve the
oppressed state of the breathing; the second, to suppress
the bleeding.</p>

<p>In large penetrating wounds of the chest, with injury of
the lung, it has been observed that the patient has breathed
most easily when the external wound has been covered; and
has been hardly able to breathe when it was opened, which
is attributed to the air getting into that side of the thorax
in inspiration, instead of entering the lung by the trachea.
If the wound admit of being well closed, the difficulty of
breathing diminishes; adhesion may take place, and the
inflammatory action within the chest may terminate; but if
the inflammatory symptoms continue, adhesion does not take
place, and the secretion and effusion of a quantity of serous
fluid are the consequence. This secretion of fluid is the
natural consequence of inflammation which has passed the
stage of adhesion, whether the injury of the chest have occurred
from a stab or from a gunshot. It is the leading fact
in the treatment of these injuries, hitherto disregarded by
writers on this subject, but on the proper management of
which, in both instances, a successful result principally depends.
If the closure of the wound lead, in the course of a
few days, to the re-establishment of the breathing, and the
antiphlogistic means employed to the cessation of all urgent
inflammatory symptoms, adhesion has most likely taken place,
or is about to take place, in the neighborhood of the wound,
and the patient will in all probability recover without much
further suffering. If this should not occur, and effusion take
place, the wound should be reopened, or the fluid otherwise
evacuated.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 9th Regiment was wounded at Roliça,
in 1808, by the point of a sword in the left side; it penetrated
the chest, making a wound somewhat more than an
inch long, through which air passed readily, accompanied
by a very little frothy blood, which was also spit up on any
effort being made to cough, leaving no doubt of the lung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
having been injured, that viscus appearing to be retained
against the wall of the chest. As the edges of the wound
could not be accurately kept in apposition by adhesive plaster,
two sutures were applied through the skin, and the man
was desired to lie on the injured side, with the hope that adhesion
might take place, as there appeared to be no effusion
of blood into the cavity. He was freely bled on each of the
two days following the receipt of the wound, and gradually
recovered.</p>

<p>A French soldier was brought into the village after the
battle of Vimiera, wounded by a sword in the right side of
the chest. He said he had lost a good deal of blood; was
very pale; pulse small; extremities cold; breathing hurried
and oppressed; had spit up some blood. On removing the
handkerchief, a gaping wound presented itself, an inch and
a half long, through which the cavity of the chest could be
seen, the lung having receded. The wound did not bleed.
As adhesive plasters would not keep the edges of the skin
in perfect contact if he attempted to move, they were sewn
together, and after the application of a compress he was
much relieved. The next day all the symptoms were alleviated,
and after the supervention of some serious inflammatory
symptoms, he was forwarded to Lisbon, for embarkation
for France, in a fair state of recovery.</p>

<p>It was the successful results of these cases which led to
the closure of all such wounds in the first instance, with the
hope of preventing thereby the extension of the inflammation
to the whole sac of the pleura, which in many instances it
succeeds in doing; and thus that which was done in the first
instance from apparent necessity, rather than scientifically
adopted, became a rule of practice, which may be laid down
as a principle to be followed in similar cases. When persons
thus wounded are neglected, the wound remains open, and
the cavity of the pleura passes into a state of suppuration,
after all the symptoms of acute pleuritis or of pleuro-pneumonia
have taken place.</p>

<p>331. If the union of a large incised or other wound by the
adhesive process does not take place, a bloody, serous fluid
oozes out from under the dressings, if the oppression of
breathing should not have led to their removal; the patient
is relieved by the discharge, which, after a time, as the case
proceeds toward recovery, will become less in quantity and
more purulent in quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
If the union of the divided parts should take place externally,
and the general as well as local symptoms become
more urgent, there can be little doubt of a collection of some
kind having taken place, and then auscultation and percussion,
if the latter can be borne, become of the greatest importance.
From the moment the wound is closed the ear
becomes the most important guide; the only one in fact to
be depended upon as to what is going on within the chest.
The case is one of pleuritis, perhaps of pleuro-pneumonia,
and hence the reason that the symptoms and treatment of
these complaints have been more fully noticed than might
be considered to appertain to the province of surgery. The
effusion of a bloody, serous fluid comes on, after a penetrating
injury, from the third until the seventh or ninth day, by which
time the cavity of the pleura may be filled; puncturing the
chest between the sixth and seventh ribs at the point of election,
or reopening the wound, should be early resorted to for
its evacuation.</p>

<p>A picket of Portuguese infantry being surprised by a
sudden rush of French cavalry from the town, during the
first unsuccessful siege of Badajos, were nearly all sabred.
The survivors were brought to me. Two had been run
through one side of the chest, and one through both sides;
the last died a few minutes after I saw him. The other two
seemed to be nearly in a similar situation from loss of blood
by the mouth and from the wounds. These were immediately
closed by stitches, compresses, and adhesive plasters.
A little hot brandy and water was given to each, and they
were laid aside without hope of recovery. They did not die,
however; the breathing became more easy, the distress less,
and the pulse more distinct; reaction after a time took
place. The next morning, the siege being abandoned, they
were removed to Elvas, where I afterward heard they were
doing well.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Third Division of Infantry, under the
command of Sir James Kempt, was wounded at Waterloo,
by a straight sword or sabre, which penetrated the left side
of the chest. He fell, and lost a considerable quantity of
blood from the mouth as well as from the wound, and was
supposed to be dying. On showing some signs of life, the
wound was covered by a part of his shirt; and on his arrival
at the Elizabeth Hospital in Brussels, four days afterward,
it was closed. On the ninth day, when my attention was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
drawn to him, he was sitting up in great distress, from
difficulty of breathing, his hand pressed upon the wounded
part, the cicatrix of which was red, swollen, and projecting.
I recommended the assistant-surgeon in charge to open this
with an abscess lancet, which he did, giving vent to a very
large quantity of bloody and purulent matter, to the great
relief of the patient for several days, although he did not
ultimately recover.</p>

<p>The advantage derived from the closure of the wounds in
these cases was manifest. It relieved the breathing, and
caused the hemorrhage to cease, aided, in all probability, by
the exhausted state of the patients. The relief to the
breathing was at the moment the most essential point, the
wounds of entrance being nearly two inches long, and the
free admission of air quite unopposed; the lung had receded
from the opening.</p>

<p>332. <i>The important question of hemorrhage</i>, in cases of
incised wounds admitting of being accurately closed, remains
for consideration. In many instances, the quantity of blood
effused is trifling, and in others, although greater, it is
absorbed without being productive of evil. In a third class,
the quantity extravasated is larger than can be absorbed,
although it does not flow in an inconvenient or dangerous
manner through the wound, and may ultimately become
coagulated and adherent to the diaphragm and spine in the
angle between them, when the patient lies long on his back.
In the worst or most alarming cases, the loss of blood is
and has been so great that its suppression offers the only
chance for the continuance of life. It is between these two
last cases only that a difference of opinion exists as to the
treatment to be pursued: one party desiring that the effused
blood, if moderate in quantity, should be allowed to discharge
itself, the wound being kept open; the other, that under all
circumstances, whether the quantity of blood poured out be
small or great, the wound should be closed, and the result
awaited. The right course is, I apprehend, to remove all
the blood which can be evacuated by position, provided it
can be done without danger to the patient, rather than to
allow it to fill the chest; but as the bleeding vessel in the
lung cannot readily be got at, if seen, nor be secured by
ligature with advantage, it is advisable, if the bleeding
continue, to close the wound, and allow the cavity of the
pleura to be filled, until the lung shall be sufficiently com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>pressed
to cause the hemorrhage to cease, if the person
survive so long. The first object is to save life; after that,
if time be given, the next will be to relieve the loaded cavity.
After the wound has been closed, and the patient has so
far recovered that reaction has begun to take place, it may
be concluded that the bleeding has ceased. The chest
should then be most carefully auscultated from day to day,
so that its respiratory state may be known, particularly with
regard to the increase of effusion, which will then be serous.
This will not take place until after the third, and not perhaps
before the fifth or sixth day, in any considerable quantity;
when, if it should have occurred, the wound should be reopened,
or another opening made at the most convenient
place for the evacuation of the effused blood and serum. It
is probable that the wound of the vessel in the lung which
furnished the blood will be closed in five or six days: while
it is of great importance that the lung should be early
relieved from pressure, that it should be allowed to expand,
and not be bound down by false membranes; which will be
the case if the compressing fluid be not removed, and the
inflammatory symptoms subdued. There is no object to be
gained but the suppression of the hemorrhage by retaining
the blood and serum within the chest; while the probability
of a return of the bleeding is not great after an opening
has been made, and the blood and serum have been evacuated,
although much mischief will inevitably follow the
effused fluids remaining too long.</p>

<p>Repeated observation has shown that in sabre-wounds
penetrating the chest and lung, which have not united, and
from which no excessive hemorrhage has occurred, a great
discharge of serous fluid usually takes place from the cavity,
which, gradually diminishing, becomes purulent, and at last
ceases, without the function of the lung being destroyed;
while, if the wound had been early closed, and the fluid
collected too long retained, the functions of the lung would
be impaired, and a counter-opening, for the relief of the resulting
empyema, may be unavailing. Whenever, therefore,
the adhesive process between the pleuræ has failed, and
great effusion has taken place, the sooner it is discharged
the better.</p>

<p>In addition to the closure of the wound, it is desirable to
arrest the hemorrhage by other means, if possible, such as
the abstraction of blood from the arm to such an extent as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
it may be considered the patient can bear, the administration
of the acetate of lead with opium, turpentine, matico, or the
mineral acids; and the external and internal use of cold or
iced water, if it can be borne. If there be reason to believe
that a rib or ribs have been injured&mdash;that any extraneous
body is inclosed in the wound&mdash;or, from its appearance, that
it will certainly reopen, an incision should be made in the
part injured, for the purpose of giving the necessary assistance.
The cure, however, will not only be assisted, but
mainly effected, by procuring a depending opening by means
of the small trocar and canula introduced as low down as
auscultation will authorize; the introduction of this instrument
will give the desired information on the one hand, and
do little or no harm on the other.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 3d Regiment of Infantry was wounded
by a lance at the battle of Albuhera, in the left side, between
the fifth and sixth ribs; and was thrown down, bleeding from
the mouth and from the wound, which was afterward closed
by his comrades, by confining upon it a piece of his shirt
folded up for the purpose. Brought to the hospital, at the
village of Valverde, he appeared ten days afterward to be
dying from difficulty of breathing. On enlarging the opening
in the integuments, a quantity of blood, partly fluid,
partly coagulated, issued from the cavity of the chest. The
wound was kept open to allow the discharge of this, and of
a reddish, watery fluid, which, after a few days, became purulent.
At the end of three weeks I sent him to Elvas, doing
well, and with but little discharge from the wound.</p>

<p>A heavy dragoon, of the German Legion, was wounded
at the battle of Salamanca by a sword, which penetrated the
cavity of the right side of the chest, between the sixth and
seventh ribs. He fell from his horse, and lost a considerable
quantity of blood from the mouth and from the wound. On
examining the wound next day, a black coagulum was seen
filling up the orifice, the cellular membrane around being
considerably ecchymosed, and little doubt existed that the
oppression in breathing under which he labored was caused
by blood effused into the cavity. On separating the edges
of the wound with a director, several ounces of blood, half
fluid, half coagulated, were evacuated by making the external
opening, which was enlarged, quite dependent. The lung
was then seen in contact with the external opening of the
wound, having expanded as the pressure of the blood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
removed from it. The wound was closed simply by lint,
compress, and adhesive plaster, without bandage; the man
was largely bled, and placed upon his wounded side on the
ground, being the most comfortable position, in some degree
relieved from the oppression in breathing. Two days after,
the wound discharged freely a reddish-colored watery fluid,
evidently from the cavity of the chest, the exit of which was
aided by keeping the wound generally dependent. This continued
for several days, the fluid gradually becoming less in
quantity, and purulent; under careful management he was
able to go to the rear, nearly well, by the end of October.</p>

<p>333. On the subject of the ecchymosis, which Valentin
considers to be a pathognomonic sign of effusion of blood
within the chest, he says: “It is very dissimilar to that which
occurs after a blow or wound, and which takes place shortly
after the accident, beginning around the wound, if there be
one, and extending from it. The patient also complains of
pain when the bruised part is pressed by the fingers. These
characters are not observed in the ecchymosis, the sign of
effusion, which always takes place near the angles of the
lower or false ribs descending toward the loins. Its color is
identical with that which appears on the abdomen of persons
some time after death, a bright violet, (<i>violet très éclairci</i>.)
It appears about ten days after the receipt of the injury,
sometimes later.” The same sort of thing, he thinks, takes
place when the cavity of the chest is filled with pus, but that
edematous swelling is without discoloration.</p>

<p>334. In order to be explicit on points so important as
those of which I have treated, I have thought it right to
lay down certain general conclusions, subject to occasional
deviations:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> All <i>incised</i> or <i>punctured wounds</i> of the chest should
be closed as quickly as possible by a continuous suture through
the skin only and a compress supported by adhesive plasters,
the patient being afterward placed on the wounded side&mdash;a
precept which is absolute only with respect to <i>incised</i>
wounds capable of being united by suture in the manner
directed.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> As soon as the presence of even a serous fluid in the
chest is ascertained to be in sufficient quantity to compress
the lung, a counter-opening should be made in the place of
election for its evacuation by the trocar and canula, which
may be afterward enlarged; unless the reopening of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
wound should be thought preferable, which will not be the
case unless it should be low in the chest.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> If blood flow freely from a small opening, the wound
should be enlarged so as to show whether it does or does
not flow from within the cavity. If it evidently proceed
from a vessel external to the cavity, that vessel must be secured
by torsion or by a ligature applied on it, all the other
methods recommended being simply surgical absurdities.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> If blood flow from within the chest in a manner likely
to endanger life, the wound should be instantly closed; but
as the loss of a reasonable quantity of blood in such cases,
say from two to three pounds, will be beneficial rather than
otherwise, this closure may be delayed until syncope takes
place or until a further loss of blood appears unadvisable.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> If the wound in the chest have ceased to bleed, although
a quantity of blood is manifestly effused into the
cavity of the pleura, the wound may be left open, although
lightly covered, for a few hours, if the effused or extravasated
blood should seem likely to be evacuated from it when
aided by position; but as soon as this evacuation appears
to have been effected, or cannot be accomplished, the wound
should be closed. It must be borne in mind that the extravasation
which does take place is usually less than is
generally supposed&mdash;a point which auscultation will in all
probability disclose.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> If the cavity of the pleura be full of blood, and the
oppression of breathing and the distress so great as to place
the life of the patient in immediate danger from suffocation,
the wound should be reopened, if it have been closed, or
freely enlarged, if small, to such an extent as will allow a
clear evacuation of the effused blood. It has been supposed
that in such a case the lung does not sufficiently collapse,
and the bleeding is therefore continued because the vessel
cannot contract; but the lung will usually collapse under
pressure of the air, unless prevented by previously-formed
adhesions, when the hemorrhage may possibly cease&mdash;instances
of which are said to have taken place, and the practice
should therefore be borne in mind.</p>

LECTURE XXIII.</h2>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE CHEST, ETC.</p>

<p>335. Gunshot wounds of the chest, penetrating the cavity,
are always exceedingly dangerous. After the battle of
Toulouse, on the 10th of April, 1814, one hundred and six
cases of wounds in the chest in officers and soldiers, in all of
whom the cavities were not penetrated, were received into
hospital. Between the 12th of April and the 28th of June
thirty-five died, fourteen were discharged to duty, and fifty-seven
were transferred to Bordeaux to proceed to England,
some to die, some to be pensioned, but few in all probability
to return to the service&mdash;being an ultimate loss of nearly
one-half, if the fifty-seven cases sent to England could be
traced. M. Menière, in giving an account of the wounded
carried to the Hôtel-Dieu of Paris, in the three remarkable
days of July, 1830, where every case was immediately taken
care of, says forty cases were received into the hospital; of
these twenty died; he states the case of ten more, seriously
wounded, who recovered; and he gives the names of seven
more, in six of whom the cavity of the chest was not perforated,
and alludes to three wounded by small-swords, who
recovered&mdash;the loss being thus one-half, even if the rest
happily and perfectly recovered, which may be doubted, thus
showing that with the ablest assistance the Hôtel-Dieu of
Paris could afford the loss was one-half. After the battle
of Waterloo the loss was much greater; with the army on
the Sutlej the loss was deplorable, in consequence of the
want of a sufficient number of medical officers and of means&mdash;a
state of destitution to which I have drawn the attention
of the directors of the East India Company in the strongest
possible terms, but which they will not rectify, but which will
some day, I hope, become the subject of Parliamentary discussion,
and, I doubt not, of public reprobation. That the
wounds of the chest with the army in the Crimea will afford
a more satisfactory result, cannot, I fear, be expected, and
for similar reasons.</p>

<p>336. When a musket-ball fairly passes through the cavity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of the chest, the orifice of entrance is round, depressed, dark
colored, and more or less bloody in the first instance; the
orifice of exit is generally more of a rugged slit or tear than
a hole. The alarm is great, and the powers of life are much
depressed. The wounds may or may not bleed; the sufferer
may spit up more or less blood; respiration may be difficult,
countenance pale, extremities cold, pulse variable&mdash;symptoms
dependent on particular constitutions and circumstances
connected with the extent of the injury.</p>

<p>It has been said that balls are apt to run round the body,
coming out at a point opposite to that at which they entered,
without penetrating the cavity of the chest; this, whenever
it does take place, is a rare exception to a general rule, dependent
on the ball being reflected from something solid which
it cannot penetrate, such as a button, a piece of money, a rib,
etc. If the ball run under the integuments exterior to the fascia
covering the intercostal muscles, it is usually marked by a
tenderness in its course on touching the part and a discoloration
of the skin. A ball may, however, run between two ribs
for some distance, injuring the muscular structures between
them without penetrating the cavity, in which case, after the
first moments of alarm have passed away, the symptoms indicative
of a penetrating wound either cease or do not occur,
although those of inflammation of the pleura or lung may
and often do follow to a considerable extent.</p>

<p>When the ball cannot be traced, the absence of symptoms,
after the first period of alarm has subsided, will enable the
surgeon to form the surest prognosis; their absence, however,
cannot too certainly be relied on.</p>

<p>A ball will occasionally rebound from the sternum, leaving
merely a black mark; from the spongy nature of that bone
in which they frequently lodge, they require the application
of the trephine. If a ball should be felt through a wound
in the sternum, the broken portions of bone should be removed
by the small saw or by the trephine, and the ball
extracted.</p>

<p>337. An enlargement of the wound, the “<i>debridement</i>”
of the French, does no harm beyond the pain it occasions,
unless there be something to be removed, when an incision
becomes necessary, in many instances, for the removal of extraneous
bodies or for the evacuation of blood, etc. When
a wound from a musket-ball appears likely to have penetrated
the cavity of the chest, and is too small to admit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
end of the finger, the opening ought to be enlarged so as to
allow its introduction as far as the ribs, in order to ascertain
whether those bones have sustained any injury, or whether
anything is lodged exterior to or within them. It is not
necessary that a man should be cut simply because he has
been shot; and an enlargement of the wound should be of
no greater extent than is absolutely necessary for the purpose
intended. When pieces of shell, or of a sword or
lance, are broken off and partly lodged in the cavity of the
thorax, which is more likely to happen when they enter
through the large muscles of the back, they will require
larger incisions to give room for their removal. Great
praise was given of old to Gerard, surgeon-in-chief of La
Charité in Paris, who, having perceived that a small sword,
after going through a rib, was broken off close to it, thought
it advisable to make an incision through the intercostal
muscles into the chest, and then to introduce his forefinger,
armed at the end with a thimble, with which he pressed
back the point of the broken blade. In a case of this kind,
the surface and outer edge of the bone should be removed,
until the piece of steel can be firmly seized and withdrawn
by a fine pair of pincers or pliers.</p>

<p>When a ball sticks firmly between two ribs, it requires
some care to remove it, as the rib both above and below may
be more or less interested, although not actually fractured.
The attempt should be made during inspiration, when the
lower rib should be depressed, and some thin but not
sharp-pointed instrument like an elevator should be gently
pressed around and under the looser edge of the ball, in
order to extricate it.</p>

<p>When a musket-ball fractures a rib, there ought to be no
hesitation about the propriety of enlarging the wound, to
allow the splintered portions of bone to be removed. It
is possible that in doing this some pieces of cloth or other
matters may be extracted, which might else glide into the
cavity of the thorax, or stick in the lung itself.</p>

<p>A soldier of one of the regiments on the left of the position
of Talavera was brought to me, wounded by a ball in
the left side of the breast; it had struck the sixth rib, and
passed out about four inches nearer the back. As the
point of the finger indicated the presence of broken bone, I
enlarged the anterior wound, and then found that the ball
had driven some spiculæ of bone into the surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
lung, which appeared to have been previously attached to
the pleura costalis at that part. These having been removed,
together with a piece of coat which had been carried in with
the ball, a small, clean wound was left, which gradually
healed up, the man accompanying me on the retreat over
the bridge of Arzobispo.</p>

<p>338. When a ball impinges with force on the center of
one of the ribs, and passes into or through the chest, the
bone is usually broken into several splinters of different
lengths, some of which frequently accompany the ball in
the commencement of its course, or are even carried into
the substance of the lung, together with a part of the
wadding of the gun, or of the clothes of the patient. These
should if possible be extracted if they can be seen, and the
sharp ends of the rib rounded off. When the ball fractures
a rib on passing out of the chest, the splinters are driven
outwardly, and should be removed by incision.</p>

<p>339. When a ball strikes a cartilage of one of the ribs,
it does not punch out a piece as it were, but merely divides
and passes through it, bending it inward, rarely tearing
away a portion. The parts of the cartilage thus bent and
turned inward are to be drawn outward, and replaced by
the end of the finger, a bent probe, or other curved instrument.</p>

<p>A ball, when striking obliquely but with force on the
chest, will frequently penetrate, and then run round, between
the lung and the pleura lining the wall of the chest,
for a considerable distance, before it makes its exit. In
this case the lung may be only slightly bruised, without
the pleura pulmonalis or costalis being more than ruffled.
In others the lung shows a distinct track or hollow made
by the ball. A shade deeper, and the ball penetrates, and
forms not a hollow, but a canal. The patient in all these
cases spits blood, and the first symptoms are severe; they
frequently, however, subside, and are not always followed,
under proper treatment, by effusion, although it may always
be expected.</p>

<p>340. When a ball fairly passes through the lung, it
leaves a track more or less bruised, which continues for a
time to bleed according to the size of the vessels which
are injured, thus making a wound more dangerous as it
approaches the root of the lung where the vessels are
largest. More or less blood is spit up, or, if effused, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
gravitates in the chest, until it rests on the diaphragm or
other most depending part, according to the position of the
patient. If it should be in quantity, the filling up of the
chest may be ascertained by auscultation, if the wound be
closed. As the quantity of effused blood increases, the lung
becomes more and more compressed, until at last the hemorrhage
ceases under pressure, if the wound be covered; and
the patient is saved for the moment, unless he should die of
asphyxia, from the lung on the other side being also compressed
through the bulging of the mediastinum on it; to
prevent which, if possible, the wound should be reopened
or enlarged, so as to take off the pressure of the effused
and perhaps coagulated blood. If the person wounded
shall have suffered formerly from inflammation, and the
lung has adhered in consequence to the wall of the thorax,
at the parts where the ball enters and goes out, the cavity
of the chest will not be opened, and the track only of the
ball will communicate with the external parts, unless the
ball shall have perforated some of the large vessels, when
he will continue to bleed by the mouth. The pressure of
the blood effused into the track of the ball, which may
become coagulated, will sometimes suffice, under even these
circumstances, to effect the suppression of the hemorrhage
which the loss of blood, the faintness of the patient, and
the weakness of the circulation, under proper treatment,
will materially assist in rendering permanent.</p>

<p>General Sir G. Lowry Cole, G.C.B., was struck at the
battle of Salamanca, on the 22d of July, 1812, by a musket-ball,
which entered immediately below the clavicle, fractured
the first rib, and, inclining inward, came out through the
scapula behind; as he spat blood for three days, the upper
part of the lung was shown to have been injured. The ball
appeared to have passed so close to the under part of the
subclavian artery that the greatest fears were entertained
for his safety; more particularly as a marked difference in
the size of the pulse was perceived in the left arm, which
did not exist before. He remained three days on the field
of battle, in a Portuguese officer’s tent I always carried
with me. Under repeated bleedings, and the strictest antiphlogistic
treatment, several splinters having come away,
and a large piece of the rib and of the scapula having exfoliated,
he gradually recovered, so as to be able to resume
the command of the Fourth Division in October at Madrid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
The subclavian artery never resumed its power, and the
radial always beat less forcibly on the left side. He perfectly
recovered his health, the respiratory murmur of the
lung being natural. He died suddenly in 1844, from
rupture, I believe, of an aneurism of the abdominal
aorta.</p>

<p>A dragoon of the King’s German Legion, shot in a
nearly similar manner on the same occasion, suffered more
severely: the clavicle and first rib were splintered to a
greater extent, and he lost a large quantity of blood by the
mouth. The splinters having been removed, after enlarging
both wounds for that purpose, and the inflammatory
symptoms subdued, he appeared to be going on favorably
for three weeks; when, having eaten some meat obtained
irregularly, he suffered what seemed to be a bilious attack
of vomiting and purging, attended by fever and oppression
in the chest; an ipecacuanha emetic having been given
with full effect, relieved him much. During the efforts to
vomit, the wounds discharged a quantity of sero-purulent
fluid, a piece of the cloth of his coat, and another of bone,
which had gone in with the ball, and in all likelihood had
been lying with the matter at the bottom of the chest.
After this he slowly recovered. This case is peculiarly
instructive.</p>

<p>General Sir Andrew Barnard, G.C.B., was wounded
when in command of the Rifle Brigade, at the passage of
the Nivelle, on the 10th November, 1813, by a musket-ball,
which entered between the second and third ribs, in front
of the right side of the chest, passed directly through the
cavity and through the shoulder-blade, from under the
integuments covering which it was removed. He not only
felt but heard the sound of the ball as it struck him, and
he fell from his horse. Blood gushed from his mouth, and
continued to do so until after he was completely exhausted
by bleeding from the arm to the amount of two quarts.
He was again bled at night, and the subsequent morning,
which relieved all the material symptoms. During six
weeks he suffered from difficulty of breathing and cough,
and from night-sweats. Some pieces of bone and cloth
came away from the wounds, with a free discharge in the
first instance, which gradually diminished until the wound
closed. In eight weeks he was able to resume his command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
More than forty years afterward I found the lung pervious;
the vesicular murmur could be freely heard even up to
the situation of the wounds, to the internal parts of which
it may be concluded the lung adhered, from the sound conveyed
to the ear on auscultation. He suffered little or no
subsequent inconvenience from the injury, and died in January,
1855, aged 82.</p>

<p><i>Case of Major-General Broke, by himself.</i>&mdash;Toward the
close of the battle of Orthez, on the 27th of February, 1814,
a musket-shot struck me between the second and third ribs
on the right side, near the breast-bone. I was then on
horseback, being aid-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir
Henry Clinton, commanding the Sixth Division. The sensation
was precisely as if I had been struck a violent blow
with the point of a cane, but it did not unhorse me. I was
attended in a very short time by the surgeon of the 61st
Regiment, when, on removing my clothes, the air and blood
bubbled out from the wound as I drew my breath. The
surgeon, turning me on my face, discovered the ball to be
lodged under the thin part of the blade-bone. This he cut
through and extracted the ball, and with it pieces of my
coat, waistcoat, and shirt, which were lodged between the
ribs and the blade-bone. This occurred about four <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> I
was then removed to the town of Orthez, a distance of about
three miles, and in the course of the afternoon the veins of
both arms were opened in at least seven different places, but
scarcely any blood came away; breathing became exceedingly
painful in a day or two, and I felt nearly suffocated,
when, in the evening, my brother, Sir Charles Broke Vere,
arrived with my friend, Mr. Guthrie, who examined me carefully.
The agony of drawing breath was such that I could
scarcely endure it. He opened one of the temporal arteries,
and desired that it might be allowed to bleed without interruption.
He afterward left me to visit some other wounded
men, and returned in about three hours, when I told him
that I felt relieved, and had much less of the suffocating pain
in breathing. He then opened the other temporal artery,
directing as before that its bleeding should not be checked.
I shortly after that dropped asleep, and on waking could
breathe freely; my recovery was progressive from that time,
the wound in front, where the ball entered, being the first
closed; but both were healed at the end of about eight
weeks, and in about ten I was able to rejoin the army at
Bordeaux.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">H. G. Broke</span>,
  <i>Major-General</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>He is now, in 1855, in perfect health, the respiratory murmur
being free all over the chest.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond, then Earl of March, was wounded
by a musket-ball at the battle of Orthez, while at the head
of his company in the 52d Light Infantry. He was standing
at the moment with his right face toward the enemy.
The ball entered that side of the chest, between the fourth
and fifth ribs, nearly in a line with the lower edge of the
scapula. He fell to the ground with great violence, and
was speechless for some time. He stated to me at a subsequent
period that the sensation he felt at the moment was as
if he had been “<i>cut in two</i>.”</p>

<p>On immediate examination there was no other opening to
be found but the <i>one</i> where the ball had entered; nor were
the medical officers able to feel the ball anywhere under the
skin or under the muscles.</p>

<p>The wound having been dressed he was laid on a door
and removed to Orthez, about three miles from the scene of
action, during which he complained of excruciating pain,
extending from the wound to the top of the os ilii on the
same side, the pain being much aggravated by frequent and
severe cough, with copious expectoration of frothy mucus,
and much florid blood; respiration hurried; countenance
pale.</p>

<p>The moving him to Orthez occupied nearly three hours; a
great part of the ground being very rough and broken, the men
could not well step together, and the consequent unavoidable
shaking and jolting caused him much pain. On his arrival
at Orthez, he was extremely languid, with a tendency to
syncope. Pulse feeble; extremities rather cold.</p>

<p>Seven in the evening: After having been faint for an
hour, he became hot and restless; pulse 108, and full; skin
more hot, and the respiration short and more hurried. After
he was placed in bed hemorrhage from the wound took place
to a very considerable extent. Eight ounces of blood were
taken from the arm. (Could bear no more.)</p>

<p>15th inst., nine <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: After the bleeding he became more
quiet, and had less pain; but he has since become very restless,
and the pain returned, with a full, hard, and frequent
pulse. The wound has again discharged a very considerable
quantity of blood. Bleeding repeated as before.</p>

<p>Nine <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>: Deputy-Inspector Thomson and Staff-Surgeon
Maling examined the wound. Mr. Maling introduced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
finger (the whole length) between the ribs into the wound
without any interruption to its progress, and without being
able to reach the termination of the passage of the ball;
and Dr. Thomson then passed a probe (its whole length)
straight into the chest, with a similar result; thus leaving
no doubt on the minds of all present that the ball had passed
directly into the posterior part of the chest.</p>

<p>Midnight: The blood last taken is very buffy; and there
has again been an <i>immense discharge</i> of blood, etc. from
the wound; the sheets, mattresses, etc. are saturated with
it; and on the floor, under the bed, there is a large pool of
blood which had soaked through the bedding. Pulse 114,
low and frequent; cough and expectoration as before; pain
violent, and great restlessness. Repeat the bleeding.</p>

<p><i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Perhaps enough has now been stated to show the
nature of the wound; and any further detailed statement of
his lordship’s sufferings, or the treatment of his case, would
be unnecessary. On the latter point, however, it may be
mentioned that, exclusive of the <i>general treatment</i>, he was
bled <i>seven times</i> between the evening of the 27th of February
and the morning of the 2d of March, the <i>cough</i>, <i>expectoration</i>,
<i>breathing</i>, <i>pain</i>, <i>etc.</i> being much relieved by
each bleeding.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">A. Hair</span>, M.D.
</p>

<p>Mr. Guthrie saw the Earl of March on the same day as
Colonel Broke, and suggested that no further efforts should
be made to find the ball, while the treatment adopted should
be steadily pursued; and in 1846, he pointed it out lying
under the edge of the base of the scapula. His grace is
now, 1855, in good health, and the chest, well formed,
sounds clearly and healthily in every part, even at the point
injured.</p>

<p>341. The ball in passing through the lung, in these cases,
destroyed the life of that part only which it touched; and
although air would pass out at the time, this would not be
of long continuance. The wounds being kept covered, the
lung did not and does not usually, in similar instances, collapse
or recede from the wall of the chest, but quickly recovers
its state of expansion, however impaired it may be at
the moment by the injury. The track made by the ball
gradually suppurates and heals, leaving merely a depression
or cicatrix on the surface attached around or in part to the
wall of the chest by adhesion. The track through the lung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
may be readily seen in such cases after death; although
during life it interferes so little with the respiratory murmur
as not to be observable, unless by its greater distinctness,
from the thinness of the intervening parts.</p>

<p>Mrs. M. was wounded by a small pistol-ball, which entered
on the right side from behind, between the seventh
and eighth ribs, just under the arm when hanging down, and
passed out in front over the cartilage of the sixth rib, more
than an inch from the pit of the stomach. She had not spit
blood, and the ear declared the lung to be pervious to air at
the wounded part, which raised a hope that the ball might
not have penetrated the cavity, although it might have injured
the pleura. As she suffered great pain twenty-four
hours after the injury, the breathing being oppressed, Mr.
Adams bled her into a hand-basin, until about to faint. She
lost nearly thirty ounces of blood, but her symptoms were
quite relieved, so as to render any other bleeding during her
treatment unnecessary. At the end of the third day she
spat a very little blood after removal in a carriage to another
lodging, and then gradually recovered. After four different
stethoscopic investigations, I came to the conclusion that the
ball had not struck the lung in the first instance, although
the lung adhered to the pleura costalis, and suffered from
some abrasion or ulceration at that point, which gave rise
to the expectorated blood.</p>

<p>These cases are instances of wounds of the upper part of
the lung, which are in general more dangerous than those of
the lower, from the vessels being larger, and from the greater
difficulty with which any extravasated blood or fluids can
escape. They also prove that when blood is poured out in
small quantity, it may be absorbed, but what that quantity
may amount to is doubtful.</p>

<p>342. In cases in which the external opening or wound
does not communicate freely with the cavity of the chest,
the principal danger arises from the inflammation of the
pleura ending in effusion, which, if not evacuated, leads to
the loss of the individual. <i>It is the great fact to be attended
to in the treatment of pistol wounds of the chest, or those
made by small balls which do not pass out.</i> All the persons
I have seen die from small balls have died with the affected
cavity more or less full of fluid. The post-mortem
reports of all persons killed in England in duels by wounds
through the chest, unwittingly attest this fact, as well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
insufficiency of the surgical treatment they received; and the
necessity, for the future, for its amendment. It is in these
cases that the stethoscope is most valuable&mdash;its frequent use
indispensable. When the respiratory murmur ceases to be
heard except at what is the upper part of the chest, whatever
the position of the patient may be, it is full time to
enlarge the original opening, or to draw off the fluid by the
trocar and canula.</p>

<p>Laennec thought that when a considerable effusion took
place in pleuro-pneumonia, filling the posterior part of the
chest when the patient lay on his back, it nevertheless diffused
itself over the whole surface of the lung; but dissection
has shown, in cases of wounds, that the fore part of the
lung may be applied to the anterior part and sides of the
ribs, while a serous effusion fills the hollow behind, the respiratory
murmur being distinctly heard above it. It is the
most important fact to ascertain, particularly in pistol or
small penetrating wounds of the chest, in which the opening
is not sufficiently large to allow any fluid effused to run
out.</p>

<p>Sir C. B. was wounded by a pistol-ball in the back, which
passed into the chest through the lower part of the lung
of the right side, and lodged on the inside of the wall of
the chest in front of the same side, sticking in and against
a rib, but giving rise to no external marks or signs of mischief
at that part, so as to admit of an operation for its removal.
The inflammatory symptoms having been restrained,
it was nevertheless obvious that the cavity of the chest was
full of fluid, and that the oppression in breathing arose from
it, and not from the injury done to the lung. The stethoscope
was then unknown, the ear was not in use; my older
colleagues were obstinate; they would not hear of an operation
for enlarging the wound into the chest; and as our
patient was, unfortunately for him, shot in London, instead
of at the pass of Roncesvalles, or on the bridge over the
Bidassoa at Irun, we let him die on the eighth or ninth day,
without all the aid which surgery might have given him.
It is possible he would not have recovered under any circumstances,
from the ball having lodged, and from his advanced
age.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Fifth Division of Infantry was wounded
at Toulouse by a musket-ball, which entered between the
fourth and fifth ribs of the right side, near the sternum, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
came out behind nearly opposite, fracturing the ribs, the
splinters of which were removed. The first symptoms of
inflammation, having been in some degree subdued by the
sixth day, were followed by those more immediately indicating
effusion; such, particularly, as great oppression, difficulty
of breathing, and inability to lie in the recumbent position,
which induced me to introduce, after a little pressure, a
gum-elastic catheter into the posterior wound, through which
a quantity of red, serous fluid was withdrawn, exceeding,
perhaps, three pints by measure. On the removal of the
catheter the discharge of fluid ceased, and, under a strict
antiphlogistic treatment, the man gradually recovered, so
as to be sent to England in the following June. If the
symptoms of oppression had returned, I should have repeated
the operation perhaps lower down. Auscultation, if
it had been then known, would have smoothed away many
doubts and difficulties.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 40th Regiment was wounded at Toulouse
on the 10th of April by a musket-ball, which entered about
two inches below the nipple of the right breast, passed
through the cavity and the lung, and came out behind at a
nearly opposite point, injuring the ribs above and below,
without entirely destroying their continuity. He was bled
largely on the morning of the 11th, and again at night. On
the 12th the bleeding was repeated; some small pieces of
ribs were extracted from both orifices, and some part of his
dress from the anterior one. He spat blood when he coughed,
and respiration was difficult. Calomel, opium, and antimony
were given in pills every six hours, and the bleedings were
repeated daily, and sometimes oftener, for the first eight
days, during which time a free discharge, at first serous,
afterward purulent, took place from the wound, after which
the inflammatory symptoms subsided; the cough became
easier, the expectoration less, and free from blood; breathing
easy. The calomel was omitted; a mild farinaceous diet
was allowed instead of a little gruel, and a very little bread
and milk. In a fortnight the wounds began to heal. On the
1st of May, some small pieces of rib were removed from the
anterior wound, after which both gradually closed, and he
was forwarded to Bordeaux on his way to England in the
beginning of June, cured.</p>

<p>Corporal Dunleary, of the 69th Regiment, was wounded
on the 16th of June, 1815, at Quatre Bras, by a musket-ball,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
which entered the thorax, fracturing the seventh rib on the
fore part of the right side, and lodged. He said he had
lost a large quantity of blood from the mouth, and some
from the wound, between that and the 19th, when he was
brought to the hospital in Brussels. The pulse was then
quick and hard, respiration difficult and anxious, and a
bloody discharge issued from the wound on every respiration;
bowels confined since the accident; was bled to forty-four
ounces; saline purgatives, with calomel, antimony, and
opium, were given until the 29th of June, when the wound
discharged good pus. From this time, at different periods
for six weeks, he lost ninety-two ounces more blood, being
strictly placed on milk diet. Several pieces of rib exfoliated.
He was sent home on the 31st of August, declaring himself
quite as well as ever he had been in his life; the ball remaining
undiscovered.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Fusilier Brigade was struck by a musket-ball
on the right side of the front of the chest, at the battle
of Albuhera; it entered between the fifth and sixth ribs,
passed through the lungs, and lodged. Three days afterward,
when the first symptoms were in part subdued, he
complained of pain in a particular spot, nearly opposite to
where the ball had entered, at which part something could
be felt deeply seated. An incision being made, the ball was
found lodged in the intercostal muscles between the ribs,
whence it was easily removed. A considerable discharge of
reddish-colored serum followed, with great mitigation of the
symptoms, after which, under strict treatment, the man recovered,
and was sent to Elvas with every prospect of a
cure.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Harcourt and Major Gillies, of the
40th Regiment, were both shot through the chest, at the
head of the regiment, at the successful assault of Badajos;
the wounds were as nearly similar as possible, from before
directly backward. They were taken to the same tent, and
treated alike with the same care by the late Mr. Boutflower,
the surgeon of the regiment, with whom I saw them daily.
The inflammatory symptoms ran high in both. In Major
Gillies, a tough old Scotchman, they could not be subdued,
and he died, at the end of a few days, of pleuro-pneumonia.
Colonel Harcourt slowly recovered, and died Marquis
d’Harcourt, near Windsor, more than twenty-five years after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>ward,
suffering little or no inconvenience from his chest,
when I last saw him.</p>

<p>Captain Cane, 23d Fusiliers, was wounded at the affair of
Saca Parte, in front of Alfaiates, in 1812, by a musket-ball,
which struck him below and a little to the outside of the left
nipple, fractured the rib, and entered the chest, giving rise
to the sensation as if the ball had passed diagonally downward
and backward to the loins of the same side. He spat
blood, and was very faint. The next day he could scarcely
breathe, was in great pain, continued flushed and anxious;
pulse 100. He was bled into a washhand-basin until he
fainted, and every day afterward, some days twice, to a less
extent, for ten days, and once again until syncope was induced,
on an accession of symptoms after an imprudence in
taking a little wine, which nearly smothered him, he said.
Some pieces of flannel shirt, of braces, coat, etc. were removed
from the wound, and several portions of bone gradually
followed, together with a quantity of matter, which
continued to flow from May until the end of the following
September, when the wound healed.</p>

<p>On the 23d Jan., 1821, I had an opportunity of examining
this gentleman. My report says, he is never free from a
little pain in the loins, where the ball is supposed to be, and
cannot take a full inspiration without pain in the chest; expectorates
more or less constantly, and occasionally a little
blood about once in three or four months in half congealed
lumps. Cannot ride or take any exercise because it brings
on the pain. The cicatrix shows a large, deep hole, and the
deficiency of the rib is well marked. The side of the chest
is altogether contracted and flatter; the heart has been moved
behind the sternum; the beat of the apex being on the other
side of the xiphoid cartilage, and that of the heart, as a
whole, is more indistinct than usual. In other ways in good
health. It is possible that the ball may be lodged in or be
retained by layers of coagulable lymph in the angle formed
between the diaphragm, the ribs, and the spine.</p>

<p>William Downes, of the 11th Regiment of infantry, aged
thirty-three, was wounded by a musket-ball, on the 31st of
August, 1813, in the Pyrenees; it fractured the fourth rib
of the left side, passed through the chest, and came out behind
through the scapula. He spat a good deal of blood,
although little flowed from the wound. The next day he
was bled largely twice, to relieve the bleeding from the lung,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
and was sent to Passages, where he was bled daily; and
thence, a ship being ready, to Santander, where he arrived
on the 14th of September. A free, bloody, purulent discharge
took place from the anterior wound, but little from the posterior,
and he expectorated a bloody, purulent matter, and
occasionally a little blood. Toward the end of September
the sanguineous expectoration ceased; but the soft parts of
the chest had sloughed and separated under an attack of
hospital gangrene, from which he had a narrow escape during
the month of October. The wound in the chest gradually
closed during the month of November; and on the 14th of
December he was discharged convalescent, his health tolerably
good, but his breathing by no means free; no expectoration.
The left arm was impaired in power, in consequence
of the mischief done to the muscles of the fore part of the
chest and shoulder by the hospital gangrene. The chest was
altogether somewhat flattened and shrunk, but there did not
seem to be any diseased action going on within.</p>

<p><i>Case of Lieutenant-Colonel Dumaresq, aid-de-camp to
Lord Strafford, by himself.</i>&mdash;While turning round, after a
successful charge of infantry, at Hougomont, on the 18th of
June, 1815, I was wounded by a musket-ball, which passed
through the right scapula, penetrated the chest, and lodged
in the middle of the rib in the axilla, which was supposed to
be broken. When desired to cough by the medical officer
who first saw me, almost immediately after receiving the
wound, some blood was intermixed with the saliva. I became
extremely faint, and remained so about an hour and a half,
after which I rode four or five miles to the village of Waterloo,
where I was bled, which relieved me from the great difficulty
I had in breathing; this difficulty was accompanied
by a severe pain down my neck, chest, and right side. I was
much easier until the evening of the 19th; but in the course
of the night, the difficulty of breathing becoming much greater,
and the spasmodic affection having very much increased, I
was bled seven times, until the middle of the next day.&mdash;20th.
I continued better, but was then seized with the most
violent spasms imaginable in my neck, chest, and stomach.
I could scarcely breathe at all, and was in the greatest possible
pain; I was again bled twice very largely, and my
stomach and chest fomented for a length of time with warm
water and flannels. I passed a very tolerable night, and
continued pretty well until two o’clock the following day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
when I was again very largely bled, by which I was very
much relieved. I continued pretty well, and free from much
pain; but my pulse having very much increased, and having
a good deal of fever, on the 23d I was bled again; after this
I continued free from much pain or difficulty of respiration,
and on the 26th was removed into Bruxelles, when I came
under your care. I forgot to mention that when I was so
violently attacked I had two lavements most vigorously applied;
salts, etc. proving of no avail, took digitalis, commencing
with ten drops every four hours, increasing to fifteen
from the second day.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Up to this period, the 2d of July, the devil a bit
have I eaten.</p>

<p>The ball in this case was lodged in the rib, which ultimately
became thickened around it. He recovered with good
health, but with occasional spasms in the chest; and died of
apoplexy, in Australia, twenty-five years afterward. His
doggerel lines show the buoyant and unconquerable spirit of
a soldier, who knew that his chance of recovery was small.
It was a most gallant, a most friendly spirit. Peace to his
manes.</p>

<p>If the ball had caused a greater degree of irritation, I was
prepared to cut down upon the rib, and remove a part of it,
if necessary; for I have seen balls so situated slip from their
lodgment, roll on the diaphragm, and cause general inflammation,
suppuration of the cavity, and death, which must
almost always ensue in such cases, unless the ball can be removed,
and the matter evacuated by an operation to be hereafter
described.</p>

<p>General Macdonald, of the Royal Artillery, was present
at Buenos Ayres, when a bombarder of that corps received
a wound from a two-pound shot, which went completely
through the right side, so that when led up to the general,
who was lying on the ground, he saw the light quite through
him, and supposed he was of course lost. This, however,
did not follow, and some months afterward the man walked
into General (then Captain) Macdonald’s room, so far re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>covered
from the injury as to be able to undertake several
parts of his duty before he was invalided; thus proving the
advantage of a shot, however large, going through rather
than remaining in the chest.</p>

<p class="h2sub">Appearances After Death, Etc.</p>

<p>343. The appearances after death differ materially even
in apparently similar wounds.</p>

<p>A French soldier, shot through the right side of the chest
at the siege of Badajos, died in December, 1812, in Lisbon,
apparently of consecutive phthisis. The ball had gone
through the chest from before directly backward; the posterior
wound was closed; the anterior one was fistulous, and
discharged a small quantity of matter, of which he spat up
daily a large quantity until he died. The lung was diseased
throughout, and contained several vomicæ or small abscesses,
from which the matter expectorated was secreted. The
track of the ball was nearly filled up, although the part immediately
around was harder than usual. The lung adhered
in many places to the wall of the chest, which was much
flattened.</p>

<p>In other cases, portions of wadding, of leather belts, of
splinters of different lengths, pieces of buttons, and even balls,
have been found loose in the chest, showing the necessity for
an especial and decided treatment.</p>

<p>A French soldier was wounded by a musket-ball at the
battle of Waterloo; it penetrated the chest, fracturing the
second rib, then passed through the lung, and went out behind
in nearly a straight line, close to the spine. Left on
the field of battle for five days before he was brought to Brussels,
he was nearly dead with difficulty of breathing and other
symptoms of inflammation, from which he recovered in the
course of the next ten days, under repeated bleedings and
the strictest antiphlogistic regimen. At the end of this
time, when apparently doing well, an accession of inflammation
and of all his bad symptoms took place, destroying him
at the end of four weeks from the receipt of the injury. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
dissection, the lung was found adherent to the chest by false
membranes of some thickness, with a quantity of purulent
fluid in the cavity. The track of the ball was in a suppurating
state, and two pieces of rib were found in the center
of its course. The whole of the lung appeared to be filled
with a sero-purulent fluid, which could be readily squeezed
out.</p>

<p>John Roth, of the 5th battalion of the 60th Regiment,
aged twenty-nine, had been wounded by two balls, one on
the 10th of April, 1814, at the battle of Toulouse, which
grazed the left temporal bone; the other had gone through
the upper part of the right chest, in the Pyrenees, the autumn
before. Both wounds had healed. He was seized on the
8th of May, after a little intemperance, with pains in his body
and joints, pain in the chest, and cough, with bloody expectoration;
skin hot, tongue foul, and bowels confined. On
the 9th he was bled, and purged by calomel, antimony, and
salts. On the 10th symptoms augmented, pulse 120, small,
and wandering, but no pain in the head. Repeat the medicines.
Head shaved and cold applied; bleeding to ten
ounces. 11th. Every symptom increased; great pain on
touching the chest; pulse 126; skin hot. On the 12th
passed his urine and feces involuntarily; and on the 13th
he died, his body being covered by petechiæ.</p>

<p>The head, on examination, showed pus under the dura
mater, at and behind the situation of the wound he had received.
The right lung adhered to the walls of the chest
where the ball had entered and passed out, the track made
by it being very visible, indurated, and inflamed, from the
last attack: the parts otherwise sound; no fluid in the
cavity.</p>

<p>Mr. Drummond was wounded by a pistol-ball in the back,
low down, about two inches from the spine, and three inches
from the inferior angle of the scapula; it was afterward
found to have entered between the eleventh and twelfth ribs,
and to have <i>passed between the base of the lung and the
diaphragm</i>, abrading the former, and passing through the
latter into the abdomen, ultimately lodging in the fat under
the skin, over the cartilage of the eighth rib of the left side,
nearly at an opposite point in front. From the absence of
all symptoms of shock and alarm, it was hoped by some that
the ball might have run round, but on the removal of the
little ball its course could not be traced. This occurred on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
Friday. On Saturday morning at five o’clock he suffered
great uneasiness and difficulty of breathing, accompanied by
a particular catch or jerk in respiration, indicating a wound
of the diaphragm. The stethoscope and the ear attested the
clearness of the respiratory murmur in every part of the chest,
which sounded well, and I was satisfied the lung was not
materially injured; twelve ounces of blood were drawn with
difficulty from both arms. At ten o’clock, the jerk and difficulty
of breathing being greater, the left temporal artery was
opened, as no blood could be drawn from the veins; five
ounces only could be obtained; a dose of calomel and a
senna draught had been followed by the discharge of a teaspoonful
or two of blood, leaving no doubt on my mind that
the ball had penetrated the cavity of the abdomen, as well
as of the chest, and that a bowel had been injured. With a
constitution apparently unequal to bear an inflammation of
the most dangerous character, or the remedies necessary to
subdue it, the prospect was but melancholy. Thirty-six
leeches were applied around the wound in front, but they
drew little blood. Pulse from 108 to 112. Dr. Hume, Mr.
B. Cooper, and Mr. Jackson were added in consultation on
Monday at twelve, when the jerk became worse, the oppression
in breathing greater. Muriate of morphia, half a grain;
at two, bled to twelve ounces; blood very buffy; calomel,
two grains, opium, half a grain, every two hours. In the
evening, bleeding, repeated to fourteen ounces; no more
would flow. Tuesday morning, at five, bled again to twelve
ounces. The ear now indicated effusion for the first time.
It was not, however, in sufficient quantity to render the
evacuation of the fluid necessary. After this he gradually
sank, and died on Wednesday morning. He lost on the
whole fifty-six ounces of blood. On examination after death,
it was found that the ball, after entering the cavity of the
chest, had slightly abraded the left lung at its lower and inferior
edge, which was covered by recent lymph, the lung
being internally sound. The left side of the chest contained
nearly a pint of red-colored serum. The ball had perforated
the diaphragm, grazed the fat of the left kidney, passed
through the great omentum below the stomach, to the part
where it was extracted, injuring apparently no important
organ in the abdomen in its transit, but giving rise to an
effusion of blood from some small vessel which had sloughed,
the blood being partly coagulated and partly diffused to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
amount of many ounces; its loss appeared to have been the
immediate cause of death.</p>

<p>A gamekeeper’s gun burst at the Red House, Battersea,
and a small part of the lock entered the middle of the left
arm, and passed upward into the axilla, where it could not
be traced by Mr. Keate, who saw him within an hour after
the accident. The symptoms which followed were those of
inflammation of the chest, and were subdued by active treatment;
the wound healed, and he returned to his occupation
in Wiltshire. Having exposed himself to the night air some
weeks afterward, the inflammation of the chest returned, and
he died. On opening the thorax, one edge of the bit of iron
was found impacted in the surface of the lung, the other
edge was rubbing against the inside of the sixth rib, which
was nearly worn through by the constant friction it underwent
during respiration; there was also a mark on the pericardium
as of a cicatrix, and of a graze on the surface of the
heart.</p>

<p>Among the French prisoners in Lisbon, in the spring of
1813, I saw a man in whose chest a ball had entered midway
between the fifth and sixth ribs, and lodged; from this a
constant and considerable discharge of purulent matter took
place. The ball was found after death lying between the
diaphragm and the spine, surrounded by coagulable lymph,
and adhering by its envelope to the spine and diaphragm at
the angle formed between them; there was a very thickened
pleura costalis; the lung was shrunk and attached by membrane
almost equally thickened across the chest, the lower
part of which was filled in the upright position by the discharge,
which was only evacuated in quantity when the opening
of the wound was made dependent.</p>

<p>A case was met with after the battle of Waterloo, among
the French wounded, which was somewhat similar. A portion
of rib had been driven in, and the assistant-surgeon was
aware that the ball could occasionally be felt. The man
died at the end of a fortnight, the cavity containing a quantity
of sero-purulent bloody matter. The lung had been
injured by the ball, which had fallen loose into the cavity of
the chest.</p>

<p>344. The removal of splinters of bone, or of other foreign
bodies from the lung, has occupied the attention of surgeons
from the earliest periods, and some of them proposed to draw
a piece of cambric or other things through the chest, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
purpose of removing them. These extreme measures have
been abandoned; but there can be no doubt of the propriety
of removing as many of these causes of irritation as can be
either seen or felt. If the ball have broken a rib, the orifice
of entrance especially should be enlarged as early and as
carefully as possible, so as to give an opportunity for the
removal of the splinters and of all angular points of bone
which may be turned inward. A little addition to the original
opening can do no harm, and if the lung should not collapse,
or should it be adherent, it will enable the surgeon to
see whether any splinters are impacted in it, and to remove
them. It is possible that the end of the finger even may be
introduced, and the lung felt, if it should not have receded
too far; as it is insensible to such an operation, no evil will
ensue; but all probings with small, sharp-pointed instruments
should be avoided. That wadding, buttons, pieces of cloth,
and of bone have been frequently coughed up, I have had
experience; but although it is said that even balls have been
thus brought up, I have not had an opportunity of seeing
them.</p>

<p>An officer was wounded by a musket-ball on the 9th of
July, 1745; it passed through the chest, entering in front,
fracturing the seventh rib near its junction with the cartilage
attaching it to the sternum, and passing out behind near the
angle of the same rib, which it again broke, together with
the one immediately below it. M. Guerin enlarged the
openings of entrance and of exit to the extent of nearly two
inches, by dividing the pleura, the intercostal muscles, and
the integuments from within outward. Several splinters of
the rib injuring the lung were removed, the smallest of which
might be half an inch or six lines long, by two wide. A
tent was then passed through the wound. The patient suffered
much, and spat a great deal of blood; pulse feeble,
extremities cold. He was bled three times the first night,
and twenty-six times during the first fifteen days, the seton
being retained in the chest the whole time. On the twenty-second
day, a piece of cloth was felt by the finger, after removing
the seton, and was extracted; a splinter was also
felt, but so deeply that it could not be removed without enlarging
the incision. As the inflammatory symptoms were
re-excited, he was bled for the twenty-ninth time. On the
thirtieth day these symptoms had so much increased that the
seton was withdrawn, under the impression that it was doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
more harm than good, and the thirty-first bleeding was
effected. The next morning the patient complained of something
pricking him within, and the parts left between the
two original wounds, after the incisions which had already
been made, were divided. The chest was now open from the
articulation of the head of the rib with the sixth and seventh
vertebræ behind, nearly to the cartilage in front; and the
whole course of the ball was seen; it had made a groove in
the surface of the lung, in the substance of which a splinter
was sticking. This was extracted, and the wound dressed
simply, after which the patient gradually improved, and was
quite cured in four months.</p>

<p>The two first incisions for the removal of the splinters
were necessary. The tent or seton drawn through the chest
was an error; and although the fortunate result of the case
depended probably on the removal of the splinters of bone
sticking in the lung, few would survive the formidable operation
performed for their removal. The case is suggestive
and instructive.</p>

<p>345. When the lung can be seen through the opening
made by the ball, or after some moderate enlargement for
the purpose of removing any splintered pieces of rib or any
spiculæ which can be felt or seen, the object is attained. I
have not had experience of the utility of large incisions for
the purpose of making the lung more visible, although the
importance of extracting foreign substances in the first
instance is inculcated, provided their situation can be
ascertained.</p>

<p>A Spanish soldier, wounded at the battle of Toulouse,
was brought to me the same evening, shot through the right
side of the chest, between the fifth and sixth ribs, one of
which was fractured, the ball passing out nearly opposite
behind. On removing the splinters by the aid of an incision,
I found that the lung was adherent to the inside of the chest,
and was enabled to withdraw from within the lung some
splinters of bone and a part of his coat. He left Toulouse
apparently doing well; but natives of warm climates rarely
suffer from such severe attacks of inflammation as those of
northern habits and constitutions.</p>

<p>A soldier of the German Legion was wounded at the
battle of Waterloo, the 13th of June, 1815, by a musket-ball,
which entered between the seventh and eighth ribs in
front, about two inches from the sternum on the right side,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
passing out behind. He died in York Hospital, Chelsea,
in the month of January following, where he was taken after
some drunken fits, which induced an attack of pneumonia.
A fistulous opening existed, and had discharged a little matter,
which was gradually diminishing; the sinus was from
six to seven inches long, extending into and nearly through
the base of the lung, and was lined by a mucous membrane,
the lung around being thickened to the extent of from a
quarter to half an inch. There was but little fluid in the
cavity, although the lung on both sides showed signs of
recent inflammation, without which he would in all probability
have recovered. The orifices of entrance and of exit
through the lung adhered to the walls of the chest, thus
separating the track of the ball from the general cavity of
the pleura, which would in all probability have led to his
ultimate recovery, if it had not been for his intemperance.</p>

<p>346. When a ball, or portion of bone, leather, cloth, wadding,
or other foreign substance is driven into the cavity of
the pleura, it usually gives rise to fatal results, constituting,
therefore, cases of the greatest importance, to which attention
has not been sufficiently given, but on which too much
cannot be bestowed, if life is to be preserved by the art of
surgery. The neglect of these cases has probably arisen
from the insufficiency of the means of ascertaining their
nature&mdash;an insufficiency which auscultation has in some
measure removed, and which the science of surgery may still
further diminish. The presence of a ball, a piece of bone,
or of any other substance, lying upon or rolling about on
the pleura covering the diaphragm, must give rise to more
or less irritation and inflammation, and consequently to suppuration,
or the formation of matter upon the surface of that
membrane in its thickened state, until, in all probability, the
foreign substance has been removed or the person has wasted
away and perished.</p>

<p>A dragoon of the King’s German Legion was wounded
between the eighth and ninth ribs at the battle of Salamanca.
The ball had entered and lodged; the symptoms were severe;
the breathing laborious. As the discharge from the wound
was not free, I enlarged the opening, removed some scales
of bone, a bit of cloth which stuck between the ribs, the
lower of which was broken, and evacuated a great quantity
of bloody-colored fluid, not purulent. After a few days the
discharge became purulent, and, as he felt something, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
thought, roll within him, which he supposed might be the
ball, I contemplated again enlarging the wound, so as to be
able to see whether anything were loose in the cavity; but a
sudden relapse of inflammation, from drinking some brandy,
carried him off. On examination, the ball was found lying
loose on the diaphragm in the chest, and might, with some
enlargement of the wound, have been extracted.</p>

<p>A French prisoner of war, who had been wounded near
Almaraz by a musket-ball, which had lodged in the left side
of the chest, was sent to Lisbon in 1812, with a considerable
discharge through the wound, and died there. The ball
was found in the angle formed between the diaphragm and
the spine, enveloped in coagulable lymph, by which it was
attached to the spine; there were some splinters of bone
inclosed with it.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 29th Regiment was wounded at Talavera
by a musket-ball, which penetrated the right side of the
chest, between the fourth and fifth ribs, and lodged. He
died the day after, and on opening the body, I found that
the ball had passed through the lung, and was lying loose
on the ribs behind, near the union of the diaphragm with
the spine.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Robert Crawford was wounded at the
foot of the smaller breach at the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo,
by a musket-ball, which passed through the posterior fold of
the armpit and entered the side of the chest in the axilla by
a small opening or slit, apparently too small to allow a ball
to pass through. I saw him a few minutes afterward with
Dr. Robb, under whose care he remained, when, from the
general anxiety manifested, I was satisfied as to the severity
of the injury. The symptoms were not at first urgent, but
their continuance and augmentation, in spite of the most
rigorous antiphlogistic treatment, led, in a few days, to his
death. On examination of the body, the ball was found
lying on the diaphragm; the cavity of the chest contained
a large quantity of very turbid serum; false membranes had
formed on the lung, which was compressed toward the spine,
and at the upper part retained the mark of an injury as
from a ball which had not had force enough to penetrate
and lodge.</p>

<p>Baron Larrey has had the good fortune to meet with
some remarkable cases of this kind. In the first he did not
see the man for some weeks after the wound had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>flicted,
the ball entering at the upper edge of the fourth rib,
about an inch from its junction with the cartilage. By
means of a bent and flexible sound introduced through the
wound, he distinguished a hard, metallic substance at the
bottom of the cavity of the chest, which he supposed to be
the ball, nearly in the situation of the place where the operation
for empyema is usually performed. This operation
having been done, about twelve ounces of pus escaped, and
the ball was discovered rather flattened. It was easily removed
with the aid of a pair of polypus forceps. After this
there was every prospect of recovery, until the patient,
having unfortunately one day drank too much brandy, was
attacked by enteritis, and died.</p>

<p>William Barrett, of the Life Guards, a middle aged, muscular
man, of full habit, was wounded by a musket-ball at
the battle of Waterloo; it fractured the third and fourth
ribs behind on the left side, and broke the left arm. He
was brought to Brussels, where the inflammatory symptoms
were subdued by repeated general and local bleedings, and
the other ordinary but strictly antiphlogistic means, during
the first six weeks, by which time the external wound had
nearly closed, and no trace of the ball could be perceived.
At the end of this time, Staff-Surgeon Collier, now Inspector-General
of Hospitals, under whose care he was, and who furnished
me with these particulars of the case, which I saw in
Brussels, finding that his symptoms became worse, that he
had rigors and evening exacerbations, and that the difficulty
of breathing had increased almost to suffocation, decided on
opening into the cavity of the chest and following the course
of the ball. This he did by a deep incision, which enabled
him to remove some pieces of the ribs, which were denuded
but not detached. A bag-like protrusion was then felt between
the ribs near their angles, which was opened, and
nearly two pints of thick, fetid pus escaped, the relief which
followed being as complete as sudden. The wound was
dressed from the bottom, and every means adopted, except
introducing a tent, to prevent its closing, but in vain; the
opening closed, and matter again collected, requiring a second
incision for its removal. Between these two operations
small bleedings were resorted to most beneficially. A short
gum-elastic catheter was introduced into the cavity of the
chest after the second incision; very little matter, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
was secreted. From this time he gradually recovered, and
was sent to England, cured, in November.</p>

<p>347. The presence of a ball, rolling about on the diaphragm,
can now be ascertained by means of the stethoscope
at an early period, so as to admit of an operation
being undertaken with confidence for its removal; while the
knowledge acquired by auscultation or percussion, of the
filling of the chest by fluid, whether serous, bloody, or purulent,
is at the same time incontestibly demonstrated. The
presence of a ball, or of any other foreign body, decides the
question as to the place where the opening into the chest
should be made. On this point the information derived
from the practice of the French surgeons in Algeria is
valuable.</p>

<p>M. Baudens, whose labors I again refer to with great
pleasure, says that he has also seen splinters of bone and
even a ball, surrounded by a cyst formed by the pseudo-membranes
of inflammation, cut off from the general cavity,
and confined in the angular space formed behind between
the rib, the diaphragm, and the spine. In one case, M.
Baudens introduced a <i>sonde à dard</i>, such as is used in the
high operation for the stone, between the second and third
ribs, and made it project behind between the eleventh and
twelfth. He then cut down upon it, and extracted a ball
and some splinters of the rib. The wound thus made was
then closed, the upper one being sucked dry daily by a
pump. The patient recovered in forty days.</p>

<p>A., 54th Regiment, was brought to the hospital at
Algiers, on the 22d of October, 1833, wounded eleven days
before by a ball, which, having broken the right clavicles
was lost in the chest, without any sign of effusion having
taken place; he appeared to be going on well, until suddenly
he complained of pain about the middle of the sixth
rib, which could not be removed by the means employed,
and was accompanied by a great discharge from the wound.
On the 10th of November he died. The clavicle and the
first rib had been fractured, and an abscess had formed behind
them, the size of a hen’s egg, containing several splinters
of bone, which had stuck in and afterward separated
from the lung. The ball had passed from above downward
and outward, forming a sinus, which terminated at the
middle of the sixth rib, to which this part of the lung was
attached; the posterior three-fourths of this canal were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
closed; the anterior fourth contained two splinters of bone,
one of which was about to fall into the abscess in front.
The sixth rib was broken, although it had not been perceived
during life; and a small digital cavity was formed at
this part in it by the ball, surrounded by portions of lymph,
floating loosely from its edges; from this the ball had been
detached, and had given rise to the inflammation which destroyed
him. The ball had fallen on the diaphragm, where
it was lying loose, surrounded by a quantity of purulent
matter.</p>

<p>M. Baudens says himself, and rightly, that the operation
of opening into the chest should have been performed in the
eleventh intercostal space, and that the wound in front should
have been enlarged.</p>

<p>M. Baudens relates another case, in which the posterior
wound, situated near the angle of the tenth rib, had healed,
the anterior one, half an inch below the clavicle, giving issue
to an abundant and weakening suppuration. The lung
above this was permeable to air, but the respiratory murmur
could not be heard below it. To draw off this offensive
fluid, he adapted an empty caoutchouc bag to a gum-elastic
canula, which he affixed against the orifice of the wound,
and thus sucked out six pints in five days. Some days later
the wound behind reopened, and a piece of bone was discharged
from it, which saved the man’s life. Two years
afterward he was seen in good health.</p>

<p>The desire to have as dependent an opening in the chest
as possible in these injuries has been manifested by all surgeons
of experience; and the interspaces between the ninth
and tenth, and between the tenth and eleventh ribs, have
been often selected for this purpose; but as the operation
was formerly done with the trocar, the abdomen was as often
opened as the thorax, and death was frequently thus caused,
even if it would not have been occasioned by the disease.
To prevent, or to avoid this evil, M. Baudens advises its
being performed at three fingers’ distance from the spine, by
incision, and he says he has frequently done it with success,
although he does not give any circumstantial directions as
to the operative method to be pursued. I therefore caused
several experiments and dissections to be made in the workroom
of the College of Surgeons by Mr. Quekett, with the
following results:&mdash;</p>

<p>348.&mdash;1. That a trocar and canula pushed in between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
eleventh and twelfth ribs, in a diagonal direction upward, on
a line with the angle of the ribs generally, will in the <i>dead
body</i> invariably enter the cavity of the chest without injuring
the diaphragm.</p>

<p>2. That the same operation performed on the <i>living body</i>
would, in all probability, if done at the moment of expiration,
first enter the thorax, then pierce the diaphragm, and
thus open into the cavity of the abdomen,&mdash;a difference in
result to be explained by reference to the anatomy and
physiology of the parts concerned; showing that this operation,
when required on man, should always be done cautiously
by incision, and not by puncture with the trocar and
canula.</p>

<p>On examining the lower part of the chest from within,
after removing the pleura, the diaphragm is seen forming
the boundary between the thorax and the abdomen, commencing
from the transverse process of the first lumbar
vertebra, and forming an arch under which the upper part
of the psoas muscle passes, (the ligamentum arcuatum proprium.)
From this part extends another aponeurotic arch
along the lower border, to the end of the last rib, called the
<i>false ligamentum arcuatum</i>, (ligament cintré du diaphragme
of Cruveilhier,) which is nothing more than the upper edge
of the anterior layer of the aponeurosis of the transversalis
muscle, folded upon itself in all its extent. The diaphragm
is afterward attached to the lower border of the twelfth, and
in succession to the eleventh, tenth, ninth, eighth, seventh,
and sometimes to the sixth, ribs, counting from below
upward. The external intercostal muscles are distinctly
seen between the ribs, extending from the spine until they
meet and are concealed by the fibers of the internal intercostal
muscles, near the angles of the ribs. The vessels and
nerves, after passing on the external intercostal muscles,
subsequently run between them and the internal ones.</p>

<p>The lower intercostal arteries arise from the aorta on
each side, and before they enter the space between the ribs
give off a branch passing backward to the vertebral canal
and the posterior muscles of the spine. The eleventh and
twelfth intercostal arteries, covered at first by the pillar of
the diaphragm, ascend on leaving the vertebræ to reach the
under edges of the ribs, and are accompanied by a vein and
nerve. The tenth intercostal artery, and those immediately
above it, run almost horizontally, and nearly in the mid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>-spaces
of the ribs, as far as their angles, at which part a
small artery is commonly given off, which descends from the
main trunk at an acute angle to the rib below, and may be
injured in opening into the chest, and be perhaps mistaken,
in operating, for the intercostal artery itself. From the
angles each artery runs in a groove in the under edge of the
rib as far as the anterior third, when they all become very
much diminished in size, and, leaving the grooves, run in
the middle of the intercostal spaces, until lost in their different
anastomoses with the branches of the epigastric,
phrenic, lumbar, and circumflexa ilii arteries.</p>

<p>In making an opening into the chest between the tenth
and eleventh, or between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, the
artery will not be injured, provided the opening be made
below the middle of the intercostal space, which is wider
between the eleventh and twelve ribs than between those
above it. The vein is situated above the artery, and proceeds
to the vena azygos major on the right, and to the
smaller azygos vein on the left side.</p>

<p>The intercostal nerves are the anterior branches of the
dorsal nerves, and lie below the arteries under the pleura
upon the external intercostal muscles, until they approach
the angles of the ribs, where they enter between the layers
of the intercostal muscles.</p>

<p>It is worthy of observation that the pleura is necessarily continued
over the inside of the twelfth rib to line the different attachments
of the diaphragm, and that an incision may always
be made into the chest above this point, if done carefully.</p>

<p>On removing the integuments of the back, covering the
muscles and the lower ribs, the broad expanse of the <i>latissimus
dorsi</i> muscle is brought into view, extending from the
ilium and spine upward and outward, and covering all the
parts of importance beneath in the operation to be described.
On the removal of the lower part of this muscle the <i>serratus
posticus inferior</i> is seen, of a somewhat quadrilateral form,
arising by a thin aponeurosis common to it and to the latissimus
dorsi, from the spinous processes of the three superior
lumbar vertebræ and the two inferior dorsal, and proceeding
upward and outward to be inserted by four flat, tendinous
digitations into the four lower ribs.</p>

<p>If this muscle be separated from its origins and turned
outward, or divided in the middle, and its two portions reflected,
the posterior spinal or long muscles running in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
filling up the groove or hollow of the side of the spine will
now be distinctly seen, composed chiefly of the sacro-lumbalis
and the longissimus dorsi muscles, sometimes called as a
whole the <i>erector spinæ</i> or the <i>sacro-spinal</i> muscle. This,
which forms a thick mass over the beginning of the tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth ribs, is not to be divided or interfered
with beyond a very few at most of its external fibers; the
opening into the chest about to be made should begin at its
external edge and go through the external intercostal muscle,
which is now exposed on a plane below it.</p>

<p>The eleventh and twelfth ribs, unlike all those which precede
them, except the first, have only one surface of articulation
with the corresponding vertebræ, to which they are
attached, instead of two facettes articulating&mdash;one with the
body of the vertebra above, the other with that below.
They form, particularly the twelfth, a more acute angle
with the spine than the other, which gives to them their
greater degree of obliquity, while the freedom of their cartilaginous
extremities enables the twelfth, particularly, to
be depressed or separated by a moderate force from the rib
above to a greater extent than at any other part, by which
means a foreign body of larger size may be removed from
between them more readily than elsewhere.</p>

<p>349. <i>Operation.</i>&mdash;The eleventh and twelfth ribs having
been distinctly traced, and the obliquity of their descent
from the spine having been clearly made out, the patient
ought, if possible, to be placed on a stool, with the upper
part of the chest supported by a pillow on a table before
him. An incision should then be made over the intercostal
space between these ribs, three inches long and slightly
curved, through the integuments down to the latissimus
dorsi muscle, and as the mass of long spinal muscles is usually
three inches in width, and can in general be seen, the
incision should commence two inches from but between the
spinous processes of the eleventh and twelfth vertebræ, and
be continued obliquely or diagonally downward in the course
of the interspace between these ribs. The latissimus dorsi
and the serratus posticus inferior muscles having been
divided at the upper part where they cover the longissimus
dorsi or the long spinal muscular mass alluded to, its edge
becomes apparent; from this point the latissimus and the
serratus are to be further divided downward. The external
intercostal muscle being thus exposed, its fibers should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
scratched through or separated in the middle of the interspace
between the ribs, which can now be seen as well as
felt. A director should be introduced below the muscle, on
which it may be carefully cut through, as well as any fibers
of the internal intercostal muscle which may extend as far
as the wound thus made. The pleura will then be exposed,
and if the cavity of the chest contain fluid in any quantity,
it can scarcely fail to project in such a manner as to convey
to the finger the assurance of its being beneath. An opening
may then be carefully made into it at the upper part of the
incision close to the external vertical fibers of the spinal mass
of muscles, <i>at the moment of inspiration</i>, and on the existence
of fluid being ascertained by its discharge, the opening
should be enlarged by a director previously introduced under
the pleura, the patient being desired to draw a full breath
at the time, in order that the diaphragm may descend as low
as possible. If there should not be any fluid in the chest,
the diaphragm, in ascending during expiration, may be applied
to the inside of the pleura lining the chest as high
even as the fifth rib, counting from above, and might easily
be divided with the pleura, if great care were not taken to
make the opening during the process of inspiration.</p>

<p>In all cases of wounds of the chest, in which auscultation
points out the presence of a ball rolling loose on the diaphragm,
this operation should be performed for its removal,
and may save the life of the sufferer. It would, perhaps,
have done so in the case of Sir Robert Crawford. At a
later period the presence of a foreign body, perhaps, can
only be known by the sounds or defect of sounds which may
be observed at the back part of the chest, in which the ball
or other foreign bodies lodge or become enveloped by matters
confining them in that situation.</p>

</div>

<p class="h2sub">HERNIA OF THE LUNG, ETC.</p>

<p>350. <i>Hernia of the lung</i>, as a consequence of a wound
in the chest which has healed, is a complaint of rare occurrence.
It appears to take place when the intercostal mus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>cles
have been much injured and are deficient, the opening
through them being merely covered by the common integuments
which have yielded to the pressure exerted from
within. It has been supposed that it might be mistaken for
the thinning of parts from the formation of matter within,
or empyema. The early occurrence of the abscess after the
receipt of the injury forbids the supposition, while the ear,
applied to the protruded part which is most prominent
during <span class="allsmcap">EXPIRATION</span> or coughing, perceives not only a crepitation,
felt equally by the touch, but the natural respiratory
murmur stronger, softer, but less vailed and more like the
sound given out by a pulmonary lobule inflated close to the
ear, but without enlargement of the part.</p>

<p>A portion of lung will sometimes protrude during the
efforts made by the sufferer to breathe, particularly in expiration,
when the wound is left open and the lung is sufficiently
free to admit of it. When protruded, it sometimes
happens that the efforts of nature are not sufficient for its
retraction, and it remains filling up the opening into the
thorax. A large portion of lung is rarely protruded, except
through an opening which readily admits of its return; but
when the wound is small, the return of a portion of protruded
lung, when it is not positively strangulated, should
not be interfered with. The surface of the lung is but little
sensible; touching it causes no apparent pain, and its adhesion
to the edges of the cut pleura is more advantageous
than its separation from it. It should, therefore, be allowed
to remain or be only so far returned, if it can be so managed,
as to rest within the edges of the divided pleura and fill up
the gap made by the incision, over which the integuments
should be accurately drawn and retained. The adhesion of
the lung to the pleura costalis arrests the inflammation, and
may prevent its progress to other parts of the cavity. That
the inflammation may extend farther into the substance of
the lung, is possible, but when the sufferers are otherwise
healthy, the chance of evil from pneumonia is less than from
inflammation of the general cavity. Whenever the protruded
lung has been completely returned, more inflammation has
followed than where it has been allowed to remain under
the precautions recommended. Three cases were brought
under my notice at Brussels, after the battle of Waterloo,
which were not interfered with, greatly to the advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
the patients. It is rare, however, to see a protrusion of the
lung after a gunshot wound.</p>

<p>The protruded lung, when left uncovered and unprotected,
soon loses its natural brilliancy, dies quickly, shrinks, and
becomes livid, without being gangrenous. In such cases the
protruded part may be removed, but it should never be separated
at its base from its attachment to the pleura costalis
by which it is surrounded.</p>

<p>351. <i>Wounds of the diaphragm</i> were known to the older
surgeons from the time of Paré; they were aware that these
wounds were not immediately, although generally, mortal.
They knew that the viscera of the abdomen did sometimes
pass through such wounds into the cavity of the chest, but
they did not know that a wound of the diaphragm never
closes, except under rare and particular circumstances; that
it remains an opening during the rest of the life of the sufferer,
ready at all times to give rise to a hernia which may
become strangulated and destroy the patient, unless relieved
by an operation as yet unperformed, but to which attention
is especially directed&mdash;a fact first pointed out by me early in
the war in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 29th Regiment was wounded at the battle
of Talavera, and died in four days after the receipt of
the ball, which went through the chest into the liver. I
found, on examining the body, an opening in the central
part of the diaphragm of an oval shape, the edges smoothing
off as if they were inclined to become round; this opening
was nearly two inches long, evidently ready to allow
either the stomach or the intestines to pass through it on
any exertion.</p>

<p>Captain Prevost, aid-de-camp to Sir E. Packenham, was
wounded by a musket-ball, on the 27th September, 1811, on
the heights of Saca Parte. It penetrated the chest from
behind, splintering the ninth and tenth ribs of the left side,
and made its exit a little below and to the right of the
xiphoid cartilage. A good deal of blood was lost from the
posterior wound, but he did not spit up any. He was carried
to Alfaiates, and there he threw up a small quantity of
bloody matter by vomiting. The posterior wound was enlarged
and continued to discharge some blood, the intercostal
artery being in all probability wounded. Sixteen ounces
of blood were taken from the arm, giving great relief, and
the bowels were opened by the sulphate of magnesia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
Sept. 29th.&mdash;Bleeding to eighteen ounces; on the 30th
he was bled again to thirty-two ounces, from which great
relief was obtained; he fainted, however, on making a trifling
exertion to relieve his bowels.</p>

<p>Oct. 1st.&mdash;Accession of symptoms as yesterday, relieved
by bleeding in a similar manner; bowels open.</p>

<p>3d.&mdash;The inflammatory symptoms recurred this morning,
and were again removed by the abstraction of sixteen ounces
of blood. Beef-tea.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;Passed a sleepless night, and was evidently suffering
from considerable internal mischief; wandered occasionally;
pulse quick, 120, and small; felt very weak and
desponding. A little light, red wine given, with beef-tea
and bread; opium night and morning.</p>

<p>6th and 7th.&mdash;Much the same; pulse always quick, with
much general irritability.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;The wounds discharged considerably, particularly
the posterior one; has a little cough; pulse continues very
quick; spasms of the diaphragm troubled him for the first
time, and caused great pain and uneasiness; they were relieved
by opium in large and repeated doses.</p>

<p>On the 18th the spasmodic affection of the diaphragm and
the pain returned with great violence, so as to threaten his
dissolution, which took place on the 20th.</p>

<p>On examination, I found that the ball had passed through
the under part of the inferior lobe of the left lung, and
through the pericardium under the heart, through the tendinous
part of the diaphragm, and into the liver, before it
made its exit. The wound in the lung was suppurating;
the matter and fluid from the cavity of the chest had a free
discharge by the shot-hole; the edges of the wound in the
diaphragm were smooth as if cicatrized, leaving between
them an elliptical opening an inch long. The injury to the
liver was through the substance of the anterior part of its
right lobe; the matter having a free discharge, and generally
slightly yellow, as if tinged with bile in small quantity.
The skin did not show a yellowish tinge, neither were the
conjunctivæ discolored.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 23d Regiment was wounded at the same
affair, by a musket-ball, on the right side; it fractured the
sixth rib, from three to four inches from the sternum, and
passed out behind, between the ninth and tenth ribs, near
the spine. The rib being fractured, the splinters were re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>moved
after an enlargement of the wound by incision, when
the opening into the cavity of the chest was manifest, air
being discharged freely from it. The shock in the first
instance was great; but after a time reaction took place,
and he lost a considerable quantity of blood in six bleedings
during the first sixty hours. The discharge, at first serous
and bloody, gradually became purulent, and the occurrence
of jaundice showed that the diaphragm and liver had in all
probability been injured. Under the administration of calomel,
antimony, and opium, this symptom was gradually disappearing,
when I left him to rejoin the army. He was sent
to the rear at the end of ten weeks nearly well.</p>

<p>On the day preceding the battle of Fuentes d’Onor, in
1811, Sergeant Barry was wounded in the chest. The ball
entered close to the nipple of the left breast, and passed out
at the back, between the eighth and ninth ribs. The anterior
opening of the wound soon healed, but the posterior
one did not do so for a considerable period, when he became
affected by such severe cough, with expectoration, that his
medical attendant deemed it proper to reopen it. The
symptoms were relieved, and portions of his shirt and jacket
were discharged. After this his health improved so rapidly
as to enable him soon to rejoin his corps. The wound in
the back repeatedly opened and healed&mdash;generally at intervals
of twelve or fourteen months; but for five or six years
it ceased to do so. His appetite was small and delicate;
flatulence was much complained of; and if the stomach at
any time happened to be overloaded, vomiting occurred.
He died of mortification of the left leg, January 4th, 1833.</p>

<p>On examination, the whole of the stomach and the greater
part of the transverse arch of the colon were found in the
left cavity of the chest, having passed through an opening
in the diaphragm extending about three inches in a transverse
direction, near the center of the dorsal attachments of
that muscle. The peritoneum lining the diaphragm was
firmly attached to the parts passing through it.</p>

<p>The wound in this instance was through <i>muscular</i>, not
tendinous parts. The preparation is in the museum at Chatham,
No. 63, Class 6.</p>

<p>A French soldier was admitted into the Gensd’armerie
Hospital at Brussels, in consequence of a wound from a
musket-ball, at the battle of Waterloo, which entered behind
between the eighth and ninth ribs, near the spine, and lodged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
internally. After many severe symptoms and much suffering,
he died on the 1st of December, worn out by the discharge,
which often amounted to a pint daily, for the free
exit of which the external wound had been early enlarged.
On examination, the lung was slightly ulcerated on its surface,
opposite to where the ball had entered, and a little
matter contained in a sac had formed between it and the
wall of the chest. That the ball had gone on was proved
by the fact of there being an opening in the tendinous part
of the diaphragm, through which a portion of the stomach
had passed into the chest, from which it was easily withdrawn.
The ball could not be found in the abdomen; in
all probability, it had passed into the intestine and had been
discharged per anum, as has happened in other instances.</p>

<p>James Wilkie, 12th Light Dragoons, aged thirty-four, was
suddenly attacked, at four <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the 6th September, 1815,
with violent pain in the umbilical and epigastric regions,
accompanied with nausea and great irritability of stomach;
pulse small, rapid, and regular. Assistant-Surgeon Egan
visited him half an hour after the attack, bled him freely,
and caused the abdomen to be fomented with hot water; a
large blister was applied to the seat of pain, an ounce of
castor-oil was given, and emollient and laxative clysters were
occasionally administered. At night the symptoms abated,
and he slept about three hours. The next morning his
countenance exhibited that appearance of haggardness and
anxiety which have always been alarming indications; pulse
feeble and rapid; the pain severe; at noon he vomited from
two to three ounces of black, fetid blood in a fluid state;
the pulse became very feeble. At four <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the pain increased,
he ejected from his stomach from four to six ounces
of dark, fluid blood that had less fetor; and at six the same
evening he expired in pain.</p>

<p>This man, on the 18th of June, at Waterloo, received a
punctured wound from a sword, which entered about an inch
below the inferior angle of the scapula on the left side, penetrated
the thorax, appeared to have passed through the
diaphragm, the point of the weapon coming out on the opposite
side of the chest between the first and second false
ribs. The wounds were quite healed, and he apparently
enjoyed good health, when he arrived from Brussels in
August.</p>

<p><i>Appearances on dissection.</i>&mdash;On opening the abdomen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the whole of the intestines, with the exception of the duodenum,
were in a high state of inflammation. On tracing
the duodenum upward a very small portion of the stomach
was found in its natural situation; while, on opening the
thorax, a large spherical tumor was seen in its left cavity,
containing two quarts or upwards of black, fluid, fetid blood.
This sac was soon seen to be the stomach, which had protruded
through the aperture in the diaphragm, by which it
was so firmly embraced as to render the communication between
the portion of the stomach in the thorax and that in
the abdomen impervious to each other. The hernial sac
and its contents were supported by the diaphragm. The
left lung exhibited a shriveled, contracted appearance, as if
its function had been impeded by the pressure of the sac and
its contained fluid. The cicatrix and the course of the
sword were well marked. The cardiac and pyloric orifices
of the stomach were in the natural cavity.</p>

<p>S. Fletcher, 31st Regiment, wounded at Sobraon on the
10th of February, 1846; died at Chatham, February, 1847.
On opening the thorax, the greater part of the stomach, and
a foot and a half of the transverse arch of the colon, with
the omentum attached, were found in the left pleural cavity.
There was an opening in the diaphragm with a rounded
margin two inches and a half in diameter, two inches to the
left of the œsophagus. The stomach, colon, and omentum
adhered firmly, at one part, to the pleura covering the diaphragm
and lining the ribs to the extent of a few inches,
although otherwise loose and free in the cavity. The parts
in the aperture of the diaphragm were free from adhesions,
and the finger passed easily through the opening from below
upward. Two cicatrixes were to be seen on the left side of
the chest&mdash;one between the eleventh and twelfth ribs, close
to the transverse processes of the vertebræ; the other between
the eighth and ninth ribs, three inches and a half from
the cartilages. The preparation is in the museum at Chatham.</p>

<p>352. These cases confirm the fact that wounds of the diaphragm,
whether in the muscular or the tendinous part,
never unite, but remain with their edges separated, ready
for the transmission between them of any of the loose viscera
of the abdomen which may receive an impulse in that
direction. That parts of these viscera do pass upward and
back again, cannot be doubted; and it is probable that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>carceration
may take place for a length of time before strangulation
occurs from some sudden and distending impulse
giving rise to it.</p>

<p>When the solid viscera of the abdomen are injured, as
well as the diaphragm against which they are applied in their
natural situation, the wound may sometimes be considered
a fortunate one; for the liver or spleen may adhere to the
opening in the diaphragm and fill up the space between its
edges.</p>

<p>A wound of the diaphragm may be suspected from the
course of the ball, particularly when it passes across the chest
below the true ribs. It is necessarily accompanied by an
opening into the cavity of the abdomen, and is by so much
the more dangerous. The symptoms will partake of an injury
to both, although they are principally referable to that
of the chest, and are those of intense inflammation, accompanied
by a difficulty of breathing, which in the case of Mr.
Drummond was a peculiar sort of jerk; in that of Captain
Prevost it was more spasmodic. The risus sardonicus, hiccough,
pain on the top of the shoulder, and loss of power of
the arm, which were all more or less present, in all probability
depended on some larger fibrils of the phrenic nerve
being wounded. The treatment should be antiphlogistic,
with a free external opening for the discharge of matter.
The accession of jaundice shows an injury to the liver; vomiting
of blood or its passage per anum indicates a wound of
the stomach or intestines.</p>

<p>353. When the patient recovers, the probability of a
hernia taking place into the chest through the diaphragm
should be explained to him. If any reason should exist for
the belief that it had occurred, he should be doubly cautious
as to eating and drinking in small quantities only, and remaining
in the erect position for some time after each meal;
he should carefully avoid a stooping posture and all muscular
exertion or straining. If symptoms of strangulation
should come on, an opening made into the abdomen would
appear to offer the only chance for life. The hernia may
perhaps be drawn back into its place in the abdomen; but
if firm adhesions have formed between the protruded parts
and the edges of the opening in the diaphragm, the case
must be treated as one of adherent strangulated rupture in
any other part, by a simple division of the stricture in the
most convenient situation. The opening should be a straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
incision through the wall of the abdomen, large enough to
admit the hand, immediately over the part where the diaphragm
is supposed to be injured. It should be closed by
a continuous suture through the skin. This operation, now
for the first time recommended, although apparently formidable,
cannot be compared as to danger with the incisions
of twelve and fourteen inches long through the wall of the
abdomen, which have been in some instances successfully
made for the removal of diseased ovaria.</p>

<p>354. <i>Wounds of the heart</i> are for the most part immediately
fatal. Many persons have, however, been known to
live for hours, nay days, and even weeks, with wounds which
could scarcely be otherwise than destructive; and several
cases are recorded in which the cicatrixes discovered after
death, in persons known to have been wounded in the vicinity
of the heart, have shown that even severe wounds of that
most important organ are not necessarily fatal. As our
knowledge of the nature of the injury inflicted can never be
distinct, it follows that every wound should be considered as
curable until it is unfortunately proved to be the contrary.</p>

<p>355. <i>Auscultation</i> and <i>percussion</i>, and principally auscultation
of the whole precordial region, have afforded means
of judging of injuries of the heart which were not formerly
known. A vertical line, coinciding with the left margin of
the sternum, has about one-third of the heart, consisting of
the upper portion of the right ventricle, and the whole of
the left, on the left. The apex of the heart beats between
the cartilages of the fifth and sixth left ribs, at a point about
two inches below the nipple and an inch on its external side;
or, if one leg of a compass be fixed at a point midway between
the junction of the cartilage of the fifth rib on the left
side with the rib and sternum, and a circle of two inches in
diameter be drawn around, it will define as nearly as possible
the space of the precordial region occupied by the heart
while uncovered, except by the pericardium and some loose
cellular texture. In the rest of the precordial region it is
covered, and separated from the walls of the chest by the
intervening lung.</p>

<p>If the chest of the dead subject be transfixed with long
needles, it will be found that the center of the first bone of
the sternum corresponds with the lower edge of the left subclavian
vein and to the arch of the aorta crossing the trachea,
the center of the second bone to the upper edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
appendix of the right ventricle, and the center of the third
bone to the right side of the right auricle, the right ventricle
being lower down. A needle penetrating the chest at
the costal extremity of the fifth rib, close to the upper edge
of its cartilage, will touch the septum of the ventricle. The
apex of the heart is an inch and a half below this, and
inclined to the left side.</p>

<p>The semilunar valves of the pulmonary artery correspond
to a spot a little below the center of the third bone of the
sternum. The aortic valves are a few lines below and behind
the pulmonary. The mitral valves are a little lower,
and still more deeply seated. The pulmonary artery, after
touching the sternum, inclines to the left, and is found close
to the sternum between the second and third ribs. The aorta
ascends to the first bone, and crosses it to form the arch.</p>

<p>One-third of the heart, consisting of the upper part of the
right ventricle and of the whole of the right auricle, is beneath
the sternum; the remainder of the right, with the left
ventricle and auricle, are to the left side of that bone.</p>

<p>356. On applying the ear to the precordial region, the
patient being in the erect position, two sounds are distinguishable
in a healthy heart&mdash;one duller and more prolonged,
the other clearer and shorter; between these there
is scarcely an appreciable interval. The period of repose
is sufficiently marked before the first or duller sound returns.
Of the time thus occupied, one-half is filled up by the first
or dull sound, one-quarter by the second or sharp sound,
one-quarter by the pause or period of repose.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine theories have been proposed, each accounting
for the sounds of the heart. The theory of Dr. Billing
appears to prevail at present, which supposes that the sounds
thus heard “are caused by the valves, which, being membranous,
each time they resist the reflux of the blood are thrown
into a state of sudden tension, which produces sound.”</p>

<p>The impulse of the heart, as far as it can be felt by the
touch, depends much on the position in which the body is
placed. In the erect position, it is heard between the fifth
and sixth ribs. In the recumbent posture, the impulse is
almost imperceptible. It is perhaps more observable when
the body is turned on the right side, but decidedly more so
when it is turned on the left. A clearer sound proceeds
from a thin, and a duller sound from a thick heart; a sound
of greater extent from a large heart, and a sound of less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
extent from a small one. A more forcible impulse is given
by a thick heart, and one more feeble by a thin one; the
impulse is conveyed to a longer distance from a small heart.</p>

<p>From a clearer sound we believe in the probability of an
attenuated heart, but we argue its certainty from a clearer
sound joined with a weaker impulse. A stronger impulse
denotes the probability of a hypertrophied heart, but we
argue its certainty from a stronger impulse with a diminished
sound.</p>

<p>The terms endocardial and exocardial are used to designate
the alterations which take place in the sounds of the
heart under disease&mdash;endocardial when they occur within
the heart, and exocardial when they take place upon its surface.
The endocardial murmur of disease, or bellows-sound,
takes the place of and is substituted in certain cases for the
first or second, or even for both the healthy or normal sounds.
The exocardial murmur of disease is heard with the normal
sounds, but confusing and overpowering, sometimes overwhelming,
them by its rubbing or crumpling noise. The
natural sounds exist, although rendered imperceptible by
the greater distinctness and nearer approach of the unnatural
or unhealthy ones.</p>

<p>The heart apart from the pericardium never moves without
a sound; the pericardium apart from the heart never
gives out one. Under disease the heart gives out the natural
sound, diminished, exaggerated, or modified, or it may be
totally altered. The sounds given out by a diseased pericardium
must always be new, (there being no old ones,) and
are described as rubbing, or to-and-fro sounds. The pleura,
when diseased, being a serous structure, like the inner membrane
of the pericardium, gives out less marked but somewhat
similar sounds (the “<i>frottement</i>” of the French) in
particular stages of disease.</p>

<p>The alterations in the ordinary sounds constituting the
endocardial murmurs of the heart under disease depend
principally on the altered state of the endocardium, or membrane
lining its cavities; the sounds given off, and called
exocardial, on an altered state of the serous membrane of
the pericardium, reflected over the outer surface of the heart.
The endocardial or bellows-sound, when it accompanies the
normal sounds of the heart, may result from any kind of
derangement affecting the internal membrane of that organ,
particularly rheumatic inflammation, or from any force which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
may compress its cavities; or it may depend on the altered
quality of the blood, from anemia. It should be present
after excessive hemorrhages have greatly reduced the powers
of the sufferer. When this murmur or sound occurs after
injury in the vicinity of the heart, and is accompanied by
fever, it indicates inflammation of the lining membrane, although
no local pain, no palpitations, no irregular movements
of the heart be present.</p>

<p>When a murmur or sound is heard of a different kind,
possessing the character of friction, of surfaces moving backward
and forward on each other, or to and fro, it is the
sign of inflammation of the membrane covering the heart,
as well as of that lining the fibrous external tissue of the
pericardium. The signs of both external and internal inflammation
may be present at the same time, and they frequently
are in cases of acute rheumatism.</p>

<p>357. When the heart is supposed to be wounded, even
without much loss of blood, there is fainting; palpitation;
irregular movement or total cessation of its action; coldness
of the extremities; ghastliness of countenance, succeeded
by great anxiety; a sense of anguish; an intermission or
cessation of pulse, followed, if the patient should survive,
by reaction, which renders it very frequent and sometimes
increases its impulse; while the anxiety is increased by pain,
sometimes intolerable, referred to the part. These symptoms
imply a serious injury, although they may not all be
present, and many of them differ in intensity. If the patient
should survive, the ordinary sounds of the heart will return,
with more or less irregularity, accompanied after a few hours
by the endocardial murmur, although something like it may
perhaps be observed from the first period of injury. The
friction or attrition sound, indicating the presence of inflammation
of the pericardium, may be absent; it will not be
discernible, if a layer of blood be effused into the cavity of
that membrane; while the natural sounds of the heart are
rendered more indistinct as the heart is separated from the
walls of the chest by the effusion which distends the pericardium,
and impedes the regular action of the heart, but
cannot compress it, as an empyema does the lung. If inflammation
take place without an effusion of blood, the friction
sound will be heard, and will usually continue even after
some effusion of serum and of lymph has occurred, as the
quantity of serum secreted is rarely sufficient to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
effused and attached portions of lymph from rolling against
each other.</p>

<p>The presence of a larger quantity of fluid may be more
distinctly known by percussion, if it can be borne in cases
of injury, the degree and extent of the dullness being the
measure of its existence and accumulation. It may extend
over a part or over the whole of the precordial region,
reaching as high as the second, or even the first rib, beneath
the sternum, and even under the cartilages of the ribs of the
right side.</p>

<p>358. That the heart when wounded is capable of recovery
by the permanent closure of the wound, in a few rare instances,
is indisputable; and it would seem, from a consideration
of the different cases which have been recorded, that
such recovery takes place in consequence of there being but
little blood discharged through the wound, or into the cavity
of the pericardium, or into that of the pleura. The absence
or the cessation of the hemorrhage by the contraction of the
wound, or the formation of a coagulum, is the first step toward
a cure, and it was to one or other of these circumstances
that most of those who survived the injury for several days
or weeks owed their existence for the time, although they
usually died from the effects of inflammation, more of the
inner lining and outer covering than of the substance of the
heart itself.</p>

<p>If the wound be inflicted by a musket or pistol-ball, it
cannot be closed, although pressure may be made upon it
for a time, so as to suppress the external flow of blood. If
this should succeed, it is more than probable that the hemorrhage
will continue internally, and that the patient may die
after much suffering, principally from oppression, caused by
the escape of blood into the cavity of the chest.</p>

<p>If the wound be a stab, the external opening may be accurately
closed, and the escape of blood prevented; but as
the pressure of the blood in the pericardium is unequal to
restrain the action of the heart, blood forced out through
the opening fills the cavity of the pleura, and causes suffocation,
unless from some accidental circumstance the opening
in the heart becomes obstructed, and the bleeding ceases.</p>

<p>If all the circumstances be considered, there can be no
doubt of the propriety of closing the wound in the first instance,
if the flow of blood be excessive and appear likely
to endanger life. It seems to be as little doubtful that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
wound should be reopened after a time, if the danger from
suffocation be imminent. The relief obtained by the escape
of a little blood may be efficacious, while it does not necessarily
follow, although it is more than probable it will be so,
that its place will be occupied by a further extravasation of
blood, which will prove fatal. It is a choice of difficulties,
and death from hemorrhage is easier than death from suffocation.</p>

<p>In the case of the Duc de Berri, whose right ventricle was
wounded, and who died from loss of blood, Steifensand reprehends
Dupuytren for having opened the external wound
every two hours, to prevent suffocation; but if death were
actually impending from the filling of the cavity of the chest
being about to cause suffocation, there was nothing to be
done but to give relief at all hazards.</p>

<p>359. When the sufferer has recovered from the imminent
danger attendant on the infliction of the injury, and the
pericardium is believed to be so full of blood or of serum as
to prevent in a great measure the movements of the heart, it
has been proposed by Baron Larrey to open the pericardium
by the following operation&mdash;equally, as he thinks, applicable
in an ordinary case of hydrops pericardii:&mdash;</p>

<p>“An oblique incision is to be made from over the edge of
the ensiform cartilage, to the united extremities of the cartilages
of the seventh and eighth ribs. The cellular tissue
being divided with some fibers of the rectus and external
oblique muscles, there remains only a portion of the peritoneum
called its false layer, above the pericardium, which
can be seen after the division of all the intervening cellular
tissue, projecting between the first and second digitations of
the diaphragm. Into this the bistoury is to be entered, with
the precaution of doing it with the edge turned upward, and
directed a little from right to left, to avoid the peritoneum.
The smallest portion possible of the anterior border of the
diaphragm is next to be divided, where it is attached to the
inner part of the cartilage of the seventh rib. The internal
mammary artery is to the outside. The patient should be
placed perpendicularly, and supported on his bed, which inclines
the anterior part and base of the pericardium to the
fore part of the chest.”</p>

<p>Skielderup recommends this operation to be done by first
trepanning the sternum a little below the spot where the
cartilage of the fifth rib is united to that bone, at which part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
the periosteum lining it offers considerable resistance, and
should not be divided by the trephine. Below this there is
a triangular space formed by the separation of the layers of
the mediastinum, free from cellular tissue, and tending a little
more to the left than to the right. The apex of this triangle
is opposite the fifth rib; its base touches the diaphragm.
The bone having been removed, the patient is made to lean
forward, when the projection of the pericardium will enable
the operator to feel that a quantity of fluid is within, and to
open it with safety.</p>

<p>360. J. Dierking, a stout, muscular man of the 3d Regiment
of German Hussars, was wounded at the battle of
Waterloo by a lance, which penetrated the chest between
the fifth and sixth ribs, and was then withdrawn. He fell
from his horse, lost a good deal of blood by the mouth, and
some by the wound, and was carried to Brussels without any
particular attention being drawn to the injury. His strength
not being restored, while he suffered from palpitations of the
heart, and other uneasy sensations in the chest, he was sent
to England to be invalided; and in November, 1815, was
admitted into the York Hospital, Chelsea, in consequence of
an attack of pneumonia, of which he died in two days, without
attention being particularly drawn to the cicatrix of the
wound.</p>

<p>On examining the body, I found that the lance, having
injured the edge of the cartilage of the rib, passed through
the inferior lobe of the left lung, the track being marked by
a depressed, narrow cicatrix. It then perforated the pericardium
under the heart, and sliced a piece of the outer
edge of the right ventricle, which, being attached below,
turned over and hung down from the heart to the extent of
two inches, when in the fresh state, the part of the ventricle
from which it had been sliced being puckered and covered
by a serous membrane like the heart itself. The lance then
penetrated the central tendon of the diaphragm, making an
oval opening, easily admitting the finger, the edges being
smooth and well defined. It then entered the liver, on the
surface of which there was a small, irregular mark or cicatrix.
The heart in front was attached to the pericardium by
some strong bands, the result of adhesive inflammation, but
the general appearance of the serous membrane showed that
this had not been either great or extensive. The pericardium
was not thickened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>

<p>If this man had lived long enough, he might have furnished
an instance of hernia of the stomach or of intestine
into the pericardium. The preparation is in the military
museum at Chatham, Class 1, Div. 1, Sect. 7, No. 156.</p>

<p>That the heart, when exposed, is insensible, or nearly so,
to the touch, was known to Galen and to Harvey. Galen is
said to have removed a part of the sternum and pericardium,
and to have laid his finger on the heart. Harvey did the
same to the son of Lord Montgomery, who was wounded in
the chest. Professor J. K. Jung not only introduced needles
into the hearts of animals, but also galvanized them without
disadvantage, although Admiral Villeneuve is supposed to
have died suddenly from running a long pin into his heart,
which scarcely left the mark of its entrance.</p>

<p>That persons may die from the shock of a blow on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
heart, need not be doubted, and that they do die when little
blood is lost, is admitted. History preserves the fact that
Latour d’Auvergne, Captain of the 46th demi-brigade, who
had obtained the honorable title of “Premier Grenadier de
France,” fell and died immediately after receiving a wound
from a lance at Neustadt, in the month of July of the sixth
year of the Republic; it struck the left ventricle of the
heart near its apex, but did not penetrate its cavity. He
was, however, sixty-eight years of age.</p>

<p>361. In wounds of the heart, all extraneous matters should
be removed, if possible, and all inflammatory symptoms should
be subdued by general bleeding, by leeches, by calomel, antimony,
opium, etc. The chest should be examined daily by
auscultation. If the cavity of the pleura should fill with
blood, it ought to be evacuated to give a chance for life, and
if the pericardium should become permanently distended by
fluid, it should be evacuated.</p>

<p><i>Lacerations and ruptures of the heart</i> have frequently
taken place from blows or other serious contusions.</p>

<p>Ollivier, who devoted much time to reading and collecting
the observations made by different writers on the injuries of
the heart, says: “That of forty-nine cases of spontaneous
rupture of the heart, thirty-four were of the left ventricle,
eight only of the right, two of the left auricle, three of the
right, and that in two cases both ventricles were torn in several
places; and that these results were in an inverse proportion
to those which occurred after blows or contusions; the
right ventricle being ruptured in eight out of eleven cases,
the left ventricle three times; the auricles being also torn in
six of these eleven cases; the ruptures not being confined to
one spot, but taking place occasionally in several different
parts, or even in the same ventricle.” In eight of these cases
he had noticed, the heart was ruptured in several places.
That a spontaneous rupture may be cured as well as a wound,
seems likely, from a case reported by Rostan, of a woman
who died after fourteen years’ suffering with pain about the
heart, and was found to have the ventricle ruptured. A
cicatrix was observed to the left side of the recent rupture,
half an inch in extent in every direction, in which the new
matter was evidently different from the natural structure of
the heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY, ETC.</p>

<p>362. <i>Wounds of the internal mammary and intercostal
arteries</i> have so much occupied the attention of theoretical
surgeons, and so many inventions have been broached for
the suppression of hemorrhage, particularly from the latter,
that it becomes consolatory to know that bleeding from these
vessels rarely takes place; that the inventions are more numerous
than the case requiring them, and that no notice need
be taken of them, they being as unnecessary as they are useless.
I have never had occasion to see a distinct case of
hemorrhage from an internal mammary artery, but if bleeding
should take place from a wound in its neighborhood, of
a nature to lead to the belief that it came from this vessel,
the wound should be enlarged until the part whence the
blood flows can be ascertained, when, if it be from that
artery, the vessel should be twisted or secured by ligatures,
and if these methods should be impracticable, the wound
should be closed and the result awaited.</p>

<p>The following method of operating for the application of
a ligature on this vessel has been proposed by M. Goyraud.
It may be done with ease in the three first intercostal spaces,
it offers some difficulties in the fourth, is very difficult in the
fifth, and is scarcely to be done lower down. An incision two
inches in length is to be made near the side of the sternum
from without inward, at an angle of forty-five degrees with
the axis of the body. The middle of this incision should
be three or four lines distant (a quarter of an inch) from
the bone, and in the center of the intercostal space, within
which the vessel is to be found. The skin, cellular substance,
and the great pectoral muscle having been divided, the
aponeurosis of the external intercostal muscle with the muscular
fibers of the inner intercostal muscle are to be separated
and torn through with a director, until the artery and
its two venæ comites are laid bare at the distance of three
lines from the edge of the sternum, lying before the fibers of
the triangularis sterni muscle, which separates these vessels
from the pleura. A bent probe, or other proper instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
can then be readily passed under the artery. The vessel can
only be secured in this way when injured at the upper part
of the chest; below this it must bleed into the cavity, unless
there be an open wound.</p>

<p>363. The <i>intercostal artery</i>, although often injured, rarely
gives rise to hemorrhage so as to require a special operation
for its suppression; but whenever it does so happen, the
wound should be enlarged so as to show the bleeding orifice,
which should be secured by one ligature if distinctly open,
and by two if the vessel should only be partially divided. The
vessel is sometimes so small as to be easily twisted, or its end
sufficiently bruised as well as twisted, to arrest the hemorrhage.
It lies between the two layers of intercostal muscles,
and in the middle of the ribs it runs in a groove in the under
part of each.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to twist and bruise the end of an
artery bleeding in an intercostal space, and I have tied the
vessel under the edge of the rib; but I have not met with
any of the great difficulties usually said to be experienced
in suppressing a hemorrhage from this artery, when the
wound was recent, and the parts were sound; no reliance
should be placed on the hypotheses often entertained on this
subject.</p>

<p>When the parts are unsound, and the hemorrhage is
secondary, greater difficulty is sometimes experienced in
arresting it, because the ligature easily cuts its way through
the softened parts, and styptics are liable to fall into the
cavity of the chest.</p>

<p>The late General Sir G. Walker, G.C.B., after scaling
the wall of Badajos, with the fifth division, was wounded
by a musket-ball, which struck the cartilages of the lower
ribs of the right side, broke the bones, penetrated the chest,
and then passed outward. He remained in Badajos under
my care during the first three weeks, with many of the other
principal officers who were wounded; and overcame the first
inflammatory symptoms in a satisfactory manner. After I
left him the wound sloughed, some part of the cartilages
separated, and one of the intercostal arteries bled, although
the bleeding was arrested once by ligature, and afterward,
on its return, by different contrivances; each time it reappeared
his life was placed in considerable jeopardy from it
and the discharge from the cavity of the chest, which was
profuse. The bleeding was ultimately arrested by the oil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
turpentine, applied on a dossil of lint, and pressed on the
bleeding spot by the fingers of assistants until the hemorrhage
ceased. He recovered after a very tedious treatment,
with a considerable flattening of the chest, and a deep hollow
at the lower part of the side, whence portions of the rib, and
of the cartilages had been removed.</p>

<p>A young man, aged fifteen, was wounded by small shot
in the chest, between the first and second ribs, and near
the sternum, at the distance of about forty-eight paces. He
ran about six hundred paces, fell, and died thirty-eight hours
afterward. On opening the injured cavity of the thorax, it
was found to contain twenty-eight ounces of blood, the lung
having collapsed to one-fourth its natural size. An opening
on its upper part corresponded to the external one in the
paries; but the track of the shot could not be traced into
its substance for more than two inches and three-quarters;
a lacerated spot was, however, perceived at the lower edge
of the sixth rib, about two inches from its head, at which
part the intercostal artery was found to be torn through;
the shot could not be found, and there was no opening in
the skin behind.</p>

<p>The discussions which took place on this case led to the
statement of an anatomical fact&mdash;that when a man is standing
erect, a line drawn horizontally from the upper border of
the second rib in front would touch the upper edge of the
fifth rib behind, and that very little inclination, viz., an inch
and a half, was necessary to make the shot wound the intercostal
artery of the sixth. Auscultation would have made
known the extravasation, and relief might have been given
by an incision over the spot where uneasiness was felt; for
the loss of blood was not sufficient of itself to destroy life,
unless some other injury had been sustained, which was not
perceived.</p>

<p>364. <i>Wounds of the neck</i> which are made with swords,
or by knives or razors, by persons attempting to destroy
themselves, are to be treated on two great principles. The
<i>first</i> is, not to place the parts in contact until all hemorrhage
has ceased, lest the patient be suffocated. In the
mean time, while any oozing continues, a soft sponge should
be placed between the edges of the cut. When the larynx
or trachea is obstructed by a quantity of blood, it may be
sucked out, or drawn up by an exhausting pump, and it may
be advisable in some cases to introduce a tube. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
trachea be cut across, a stitch will be necessary to keep the
ends in contact. The <i>second</i> is, to keep the divided parts
in contact afterward, by position and bandage, but not <i>by
suture</i>. If the œsophagus be wounded, nourishment should
be administered by a gum-elastic tube introduced through
the nares into the stomach. It is almost unnecessary to
add that the artery, if wounded, should be secured by ligature.
A hole in the internal jugular vein may be closed by
a thread passed around it when raised by a tenaculum.</p>

<p>Captain Hall, of the 43d Regiment, was wounded by a
ball which passed between the upper part of the back of the
larynx and the termination of the pharynx, without causing
much further inconvenience than the loss of voice. In this
instance it must have been the superior laryngeal nerve that
was injured, and not the recurrent, yet the voice could only
be heard in a whisper, and was not completely recovered for
years. If a ball should lodge in the trachea, it must be
removed by the operation of laryngotomy or tracheotomy, if
the original wound cannot be enlarged; although Birch,
says Christopher Wren, hung up a man wounded in this
way by the heels, when the ball dropped out through the
glottis and mouth. General Sir E. Packenham, who was
killed at New Orleans by a ball which went through the
common iliac artery, had been twice shot through the neck
in earlier life. The first shot, which went through high up
from right to left, turned his head a little to the right. The
second shot, from left to right, brought it straight. My
kind and excellent friend had ever afterward a great respect
and regard for the doctors and a strong feeling for the
wounded. The recollection of that regard, and the advantages
derived from it, have made me sometimes think it
might be advantageous for the unfortunate as well as for the
doctors if every general could be at least shot once through
the neck or the body, before he was raised to the command
of an army in the field; for there is nothing like actual
experience of suffering to make men feel for their fellow-creatures
in distress. A Minister at War would not perhaps
be the worse for a little personal experience in this
matter.</p>

<p>365. <i>Wounds of the face</i> made by swords or sharp-cutting
instruments should be always retained in contact by
sutures. When the cut is of small extent, and not deep,
the skin only should be included by the thread, and that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
the slightest possible manner, and the part supported by
adhesive plaster and bandage. When the cheek is divided
into the mouth, one, two, or more sutures may require to be
inserted more deeply, but the deformity of a broad cicatrix
will in general be avoided, by carefully sewing up the whole
line, taking the very edge of skin only; and a cut in the bone
or bones of the cheek should not prevent the attempt being
made to unite the external wound over it.</p>

<p>Incised or even lacerated wounds of the eyelids and brows
should be united by suture, as far as can possibly be done in
the first instance, by which a subsequent painful operation
may be avoided; great care should be taken in doing
this; the suture must be inserted through the eyelid, and a
leaden thread is often the best, the first being introduced at
the very edge of the lid, and two, or as many more afterward
as may be necessary. They may remain for three or
more days, as circumstances seem to require. If the eye be
wounded, any part protruding beyond the sclerotic coat
should be cut off with scissors; but the eye, however injured,
should not be removed unless the ball be detached in every
direction, or destroyed. The treatment should be strictly
antiphlogistic, in order to prevent suppuration of the eyeball,
which may in general be effected, if too much injury
have not been done to it, and if the treatment be sufficiently
decided and well continued. These observations apply to
the nose and ears, and all parts not actually separated&mdash;or,
if separated, for a short time only&mdash;should be replaced in
the manner directed, and every attempt made to procure
reunion. If this should fail, surgery may yet be able to
yield assistance by replacing the loss by a piece of integument
dislodged from the neighboring parts&mdash;a proceeding
requiring a separate consideration. Injuries from musket-balls
are often attended by considerable laceration, particularly
when near the eyelids. Whenever this occurs, the
parts likely to adhere should be brought together by suture,
after any splinters of bone which may present themselves,
or can be seen or felt, have been removed from the holes
made by the ball. If the bones should be broken, and not
splintered, they will frequently reunite under proper management.</p>

<p>366. <i>Wounds of the eye</i> from small shot are remediable
when these small bodies lodge in the cornea or sclerotica,
whence they may be removed by any sharp-pointed instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>ment.
When a shot or piece of a copper cap is driven
through the cornea, into the iris, or lies in the anterior chamber,
it should be removed by an incision to the extent of
about one-fourth or one-fifth of the cornea, near its junction
with the sclerotica, but in these cases a cataract, if not amaurosis,
frequently results. When the shot passes through all
the coats of the eye, it can neither be seen nor removed with
safety; vision will be lost, much pain may be endured, and
the eye will frequently be destroyed by suppuration, or by a
gradual softening, and ultimate diminution in size. A contused
wound from a large shot which only injures the coats
of the eye, but does not perforate them, will oftentimes be
cured by a proper antiphlogistic treatment, which in all
cases should be most strictly enforced, although loss of sight
is a frequent consequence after such injuries.</p>

<p>When a ball lodges behind the eye, it usually causes protrusion,
inflammation, and suppuration of that organ. If it
be not discovered by the usual means, its lodgment may be
suspected from the gradual protrusion and inflammation of
the eye itself. If it be discovered, it should be removed
together with the eye, if such proceeding be necessary for its
exposure. If suppuration have commenced in the eye, a
deep incision into the organ will arrest, if not prevent, the
horrible sufferings about to take place, and allow of the removal
of the offending cause. If the eye remain in a state
of chronic disease and suffering, a similar incision will give
the desired relief. If the chronic state of irritation affect the
other eye, the incision and sinking of the ball of the one first
affected or injured is urgently demanded, and should not be
delayed. If the back part of the eye be left with the muscles
attached to it, a stump remains, against which an artificial
eye may be fitted, so as sometimes to render the loss of
the natural one almost unobservable.</p>

<p>367. I have several times seen both eyes destroyed and
sunk by one ball, with little other inconvenience to the patient;
one eye sunk, the other amaurotic, and both even
amaurotic, almost without a sign of injury, by balls which
had passed from side to side through both orbits, but behind
the eyes. When the eye becomes amaurotic from a lesion of
the first branch of the fifth pair of nerves, the pupil does not
become dilated; the iris retains its usual action, although
the retina may be insensible and vision destroyed. This was
well shown in the case of the late Major-General Sir A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Leith, who was wounded by a sword in the forehead, this
nerve being divided. It has so often occurred as to leave
no doubt of the fact, and of the error formerly existing on
this point.</p>

<p>368. Penetrating wounds implicating the bones of the
face are always distressing. When the bones of the nose are
carried away, there must always be some deformity remaining,
although there is oftentimes but little suffering. When
these bones are merely splintered and depressed, great pains
should be taken to keep them properly elevated. If the
duct of the parotid gland be implicated by an incised wound,
care should be taken to divide the cheek into the mouth, if
it should not have been already done, and to keep the incised
wound open until the external one is closed. If a salivary
fistula have formed externally, from inattention or
otherwise, it must be treated according to the ordinary
methods adopted in such cases. When a wound of the gland
itself becomes fistulous, and weeps, which is a rare occurrence,
it will be best treated by actual or potential cauterization,
if moderate pressure should fail. When these wounds
are of some extent, they are often followed by partial paralysis,
in consequence of the seventh pair of nerves being
injured, when the mouth is drawn somewhat to the other
side. When the lachrymal bones or sac are injured by balls
or swords, the tears usually continue through life to run
over, and give inconvenience, although much good may be
done by early attention to the injuries of this part. Wounds
injuring the upper jaw are oftentimes followed by much suffering,
and by permanent inconvenience.</p>

<p>General Sir Colin Halkett, G.C.B., was wounded on the
18th of June, at Waterloo, when in front of his brigade,
which was formed in squares for the reception of the French
cavalry, by a pistol-ball, fired by the officer commanding
them, which struck him in the neck, and gave him great
pain, but without doing much mischief. A second shot
shortly afterward wounded him in the thigh, and he was
obliged to leave the field toward the close of the day, by a
third musket-ball, which struck him on the face, when standing
sideways toward the enemy. It entered a little below
the outer part of the cheek-bone on the left side, and, taking
an oblique direction downward and forward, shattered and
destroyed in its course several of the double teeth in the
upper jaw, fracturing the palate from its posterior part, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>ward
to the front teeth. The ball then took a direction
obliquely upward, destroying the teeth of the opposite side
of the upper jaw, which bone it also broke, and lodged under
the fleshy part of the cheek. These wounds gave great pain,
and until the ball was removed, the left ear was totally insensible
to sound and all external impressions, although the
general suffered much from distressing noises in his ear.
These subsided on the removal of the ball some days afterward.</p>

<p>The treatment of this wound, however, was most painful;
the extraction of several pieces of bone was necessary at different
times, during the three following years, before the
wounds were finally closed. Considerable derangement of
health followed, the deafness remains; and the general has
ever since been subjected to attacks in the head of an increasing
and most distressing nature.</p>

<p>369. Wounds of the lower jaw are perhaps more common,
and are certainly more troublesome than those of the upper;
they are more difficult of management, and, for the most
part, end in greater deformity, unless particular care be
taken to prevent it, and then only in very severe cases, by
operations which were formerly not in use, but which the
intrepidity of the surgeons of the present day have deprived
of all their terrors. I mean the methodical division of the
soft parts, the sawing off and removal of the broken pieces
of bone, and the rounding off of those parts of the jaw which
may remain irregular and pointed. M. Baudens has given
two good examples of the success of this proceeding during
his campaigns in Algeria. In the first case, the ball entered
at the middle of the left cheek, and came out by the side of
the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra. The
ascending ramus of the lower jaw was broken into numerous
splinters. M. Baudens divided the soft parts down to the
bone, entering the straight bistoury four lines, or the third
of an inch, below the articulation of the jaw with the temporal
bone. He then carried it downward, and a little obliquely
forward, so as to terminate it in the fibers of the
masseter muscle, about half an inch below the base of the
bone. This incision was begun below the seventh pair of
nerves, and exposed the parotid gland divided vertically at
its middle part. The splinters were removed, a part of the
pterygoideus internus muscle was divided, and a projecting
point of bone attached to it sawn off. He then separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
the attachments of the buccinator, temporal, and pterygoideus
externus muscles, divided the ligaments, and removed
the coronoid and articulating processes, taking care to avoid
the fifth and seventh pairs of nerves. The bleeding from two
arteries was suppressed by twisting their ends; and the parts
were afterward brought together by sutures, which remained
for eight days. A month after the operation the patient ate
solid food, and in six weeks was cured. In the second case,
the ball entered near the left commissure of the lip, and
came out behind on the side of the middle of the neck; three
inches of the jaw were splintered, the ends of the bone being
sharp and angular. In order to remove the splinters, and
to prevent the evils anticipated, M. Baudens divided the lip
from the angle downward and outward, below the base of
the bone, as far back as the edge of the masseter muscle.
He then separated the flaps, and sawed the jaw across, first
near the symphysis, and then behind, outside the attachment
of the masseter. The facial artery was twisted, four sutures
were inserted, and the jaw duly supported. The patient was
bled twice, and in six weeks was cured; at the end of that
time he could eat solid food. After the healing of such
wounds, mechanical means are often necessary to enable the
sufferer to eat and to live without causing disgust to his
neighbors and his friends.</p>

<p>It is said there are fifteen men in the Hôtel des Invalides,
in Paris, wearing silver masks on the lower part of their
faces, in consequence of injuries of this kind.</p>

<p>Colonel Carleton was an instance of a ball fracturing the
jaw directly through its body, near where the masseter muscle
is attached on both sides; the jaw was broken into three
pieces, besides splinters; several teeth were knocked out, and
the tongue very much hurt. By sawing off the splinters both
from within and without, and by cleansing and supporting
the parts with great care, he recovered after a length of
time, the deformity after such a wound being much less than
might be expected.</p>

<p>370. Incised wounds of the tongue do sometimes give rise
to hemorrhage somewhat difficult to restrain, particularly
if it occur a few days after the receipt of the injury, when
the tongue is swollen and painful. It does not so frequently
occur after gunshot wounds. As the vessels of one side do
not communicate with those of the other, any bleeding which
continues after the artery of one side has been properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
secured, can only take place from a wound of the artery of
the other, which must then also be tied. This should be
done by drawing the tongue as far as possible out of the
mouth by a flat pair of forceps, which may be easily effected
at an early period, when it is not tender and painful. At a
later date, and under difficult circumstances, various styptics,
such as the mineral acids, nitrate of silver, etc., will be useful.
The actual cautery has been recommended, but I have
never seen it used in such cases.</p>

<p>371. One of the most curious instances of the lodgment
of a foreign body in the face occurred in the person of Captain
Fritz, at Ceylon; his gun burst in his hand, and drove
the iron breech into the forehead, whence it descended into
the nares, and, at the end of a year, part of it made its appearance
in the mouth, through the palate. He died eight
years afterward, having suffered much inconvenience from
the offensive discharge it occasioned. When the iron was
removed, it had obviously injured no part of any material
importance to life. I have seen balls descend in this way
into the throat and soft palate, and have removed them from
both places with success, and from the hard palate with equal
surprise and advantage to the patient. I have known a ball
lodge in the superior maxillary sinus for months, and even
for years, before it was removed, or the death of the patient
proved the fact.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LECTURE_XXVII">LECTURE XXVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">STRUCTURE OF AN INTESTINE, ETC.</p>

<p>372. If an intestine be divided circularly in any part, its
walls will be found to be composed of three principal coats
or tunics, which are&mdash;commencing from the inside&mdash;the mucous,
the muscular, and the serous or peritoneal, each being
separated from the other by a layer of areolar tissue. A
diagram thus made would show a transverse division of the
intestine, and eight distinct if not all different parts. Beginning
from without, viz., serous or peritoneal, areolar or
sub-serous; longitudinal muscular, areolar; transverse muscular,
areolar or sub-mucous, and epithelial. The mucous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
coat in man has a peculiarity not observable in animals, of
ledges or shelves projecting into its cavity.</p>

<p>When the mucous coat of the duodenum is examined with
the naked eye, the first part of its course presents a tolerably
smooth appearance, gradually, however, becoming irregular
in transverse folds, which are so numerous, marked, and
regular in the jejunum and ileum as to have obtained from
the earliest times the name of valvulæ conniventes. They
are most strongly marked in the jejunum, and gradually disappear
toward the lower part of the ileum, the inner surface
of the large intestines being still smoother than any part of
the small, although large pouches or cells are formed in the
colon by a peculiar arrangement of the muscular coat.
These valves never extend completely round the inside of
the intestine, and rarely more than half or two-thirds, although
they sometimes bifurcate. They have a velvety
appearance, which has obtained for this coat the name of
villous as well as that of mucous.</p>

<p>Valvulæ conniventes are peculiar to man; none exist in
the ourang-outang or chimpanzee. In the frog there are
valvular folds, appearing, at first sight, like the valvulæ
conniventes of the human subject; but, on a careful examination,
they are found to be mere elevations, without villi.
In the tortoise there are similar folds, running however in a
longitudinal or opposite direction. In the rhinoceros the
mucous membrane is raised up into villiform processes, somewhat
like the valvulæ conniventes, or large villi; but they
are not villi, as each process is covered with other projections
which really are villi. A valvula connivens consists of
two layers of mucous membrane and sub-mucous tissue, but
the muscular coat is not continued into it.</p>

<p>373. When examined microscopically, the velvety appearance
is found to consist of innumerable small processes which
have been called villi, each villus being composed principally
of a very thin, transparent <i>basement</i> or <i>germinal membrane</i>,
forming a sheath or case, inclosing within it an artery, a
vein, a capillary plexus, and an absorbent vessel termed <i>lacteal</i>.
A nerve has not been discovered, although it is presumed
to exist. These villi are longest in the duodenum,
and gradually diminish in number and in size from 1/25 to 1/50
of an inch. Between these villi or projections, holes or
openings are observable, termed the follicles of Lieberkühn,
who first described them; they resemble inverted villi, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
in some instances as deep as the villi are long. Unlike the
villi, they are found throughout the intestines. The villi in
every part in common with all mucous membranes are covered,
and the follicles are lined by epithelium, which in this
instance is the columnar, situated on the basement membrane,
each column being attached by its pointed extremity. A
layer of this epithelium extends between the villi, down to
the lower part of each follicle, each column being, generally
speaking, shorter and rounder than when covering the villi.</p>

<p>The office of the epithelium of the villi has been stated to
be <i>protective</i>, that of the follicles to be <i>secretive</i>. A villus,
when duly magnified, is seen to have a bulbous extremity
without an opening, and to be covered by epithelium when
the intestine is in a state of quiescence, uncalled upon for
any purpose of digestion. When digestion commences, the
epithelium, according to the researches of Mr. Goodsir, is
separated and thrown off. As the chyme begins to pass
along the small intestine, an increased quantity of blood circulates
in the capillaries of the gut. In consequence of this
increased flow of blood, or from some other cause, the internal
surface of the gut throws off the epithelium of both villi
and follicles, which is intermixed with the chyme in the cavity
of the gut. The cast-off epithelium, forming 19/20ths of the
covering of the villus, is of two kinds, that which covers the
villi, and which from the duty it performs may be termed
<i>protective</i>, and that which lines the follicles and may be
termed <i>secretive</i>, each column having a nucleus situated at
some part of it, and bulging out that part.</p>

<p>The villi being now turgid with blood, erected and naked,
and covered by the chyme mingled with the cast-off epithelia,
commence their functions. The summit of the villus
becomes at first somewhat flattened and crowded under the
basement membrane with a number of newly-formed and
perfectly spherical vesicles, varying from 1000 to less than
2000 of an inch in size. Toward the body of the villus or
the inner edge of the vesicular mass, minute granular or
oily particles are situated in great numbers, and gradually
pass into the granular texture of the substance of the villus.
As the process advances lacteal vessels are shown passing
up from the root of the villus, subdividing and looping as
they approach the spherical mass, which in this stage has become
more distinctly vesicular, although no distinct communication
can be detected between them. The blood-vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
and capillaries shown in injected preparations are now seen
colored red with their own blood, and running up to the
basement membrane, looping with each other immediately
beneath it, and ending in one or more venous trunks. The
vesicles, quite distended and grouped in masses, push forward
the membrane, and give to it by these inequalities an appearance
resembling that of a mulberry.</p>

<p>The minute vesicles above noticed fulfill the important office
of absorption, by drawing into their cavities through their
walls, by a process called <i>endosmosis</i>, that portion of the
chyme necessary to form chyle; when filled with it they burst
or dissolve, their contents being thus discharged into the
texture or substance of the villus, fit to be taken up by the
granular vesicles interspersed among the terminal loops of
the lacteals, and communicating with their trunks, running
up from the root of the villus in their center. Absorption
is thus shown to be effected by closed vesicles, and not by
vessels opening on the surface of the villus.</p>

<p>The <i>débris</i> and the contents of the dissolved chyle cells,
etc. pass into the looped net-work of lacteals, as in other
lymphatics. When the gut contains no more chyme, the
flow of blood to the mucous membrane diminishes, the development
of new vesicles ceases, the lacteals empty themselves,
the villi become flaccid, and the cast-off epithelium
is reproduced, apparently from the nuclei in the basement
membrane, in the intervals of digestion, showing that this
function should only be induced at regular periods, the presumed
special use of the epithelium being to prevent, in a
measure, the absorption of any effete or other matters which
might exert a deleterious influence oh the system, the epithelium
of the follicles now secreting a mucus which may be
considered protective.</p>

<p>In the large intestines there are no villi, but the whole
surface is covered with follicles which must be capable of
absorbing as well as of secreting, as it is ascertained that
persons can be nourished and kept alive for many weeks
by nutritious enemata which do not pass into the small
intestines.</p>

<p>374. On examining the mucous membrane of the stomach,
its follicular structure is immediately seen, the follicles resembling
much in appearance those of the intestine; but in
the stomach minute tubes are found opening into the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
of each follicle, fulfilling in all probability a different office,
the follicles being lined by columnar epithelium, the tubes
by spheroidal or glandular epithelium; it is therefore presumed
that the gastric juice is secreted by the tubes, the
mucus by the follicles. The tubes differ in the middle and
lower parts of the stomach, by being longer or more deeply
seated, and more numerous as they approach the pylorus,
showing in all probability a difference of function between
the upper and middle, and the pyloric or lower extremity of
the organ.</p>

<p>The intestines are supplied with glands, not apparently for
the purposes of absorption, but of secretion; these require
attention. They are the duodenal of Brunner, the agminated
of our countryman, Nehemiah Grew, and of Peyer, and the
solitary, which are found in the lower part of the small and
in the whole course of the large intestines.</p>

<p>The <i>glands of Brunner</i> are situated at the commencement
of the duodenum, within an inch of the pylorus, and
are not visible until the serous and muscular coats have been
removed from without. They appear to the naked eye like
the little white eggs of an insect. Under the microscope
each little gland is found to be lobulated, very much resembling
a small portion of a salivary gland or pancreas, each
lobule having an excretory duct, which unites with those
from other lobules to form one larger one opening on the
mucous surface of the bowel. The lobules themselves are
made up of vesicles, within which the secretory cells are
discernible.</p>

<p>The <i>agminated</i> glands of <i>Grew</i> and <i>Peyer</i>, by the latter
of whom they were more minutely described, occur in oval
patches at irregular distances throughout the jejunum and
ileum, and are situated on the side immediately opposite the
part where the mesentery is united to the bowel. Each
gland resembles somewhat a Florence oil-flask in shape, the
small end or mouth, which is more or less pointed, projecting
through among the villi or the follicles. They are composed
of cells, supplied by capillary vessels, which Mr.
Quekett says have the peculiarity of being unsupported by
areolar tissue, and are termed by him, in consequence, <i>naked</i>.
These are the glands which are found more or less diseased
after phthisis and fevers which have terminated fatally. The
oval form of the patches is retained, although considerably
raised above the general surface of the mucous membrane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
and when injected the parts around are more vascular, the
ulcerated portion being less so than usual.</p>

<p>The <i>solitary</i> glands are best seen in the cœcum and appendix
vermiformis. They are well developed in the fœtus,
projecting slightly above the mucous membrane. Each gland
may be considered as one of the agminated form much enlarged,
and when the free surface is very flat, an opening
may be easily seen in the center. These glands also are
frequently the seat of ulceration in fever and dysentery, and
particularly in phthisis. The follicles partake of this disease,
and the whole mucous coat may be destroyed. In
some cases there is an attempt at healing, and the edges of
the ulcers become more vascular and even villous.</p>

<p>The sub-mucous areolar tissue&mdash;the tunica nervosa of
Haller, the <i>fibrous lamella</i> of Cruveilhier&mdash;separating yet
connecting the mucous with the muscular coat of the intestine,
is composed of the yellow elastic and of the white or
non-elastic fibers, the latter of which predominate. It is
more firmly connected with the mucous than with the muscular
coat, and in it the blood-vessels and nerves are supported
prior to their distribution in the mucous membrane.
This sub-mucous tissue or structure prevails also in the
stomach, and is often much altered by disease, becoming
thicker, and assuming a more dense and sometimes an
almost gristly hardness. It is an important part in the
surgical treatment of wounds of the intestines, being firmer,
stronger, and more elastic in reptiles, and more distinct in
carnivorous than in herbivorous animals or in man.</p>

<p>375. The muscular coat of the intestines is in two layers,
the internal being composed of fibers running transversely,
the outer fibers running longitudinally; they are thickest in
the duodenum and rectum. They are of the <i>involuntary</i>
or unstriped kind, as opposed to the <i>voluntary</i> or striped,
which are of large size, and characterized by striæ running
transversely and longitudinally.</p>

<p>The involuntary fibers, on the contrary, are much smaller
in size, are always more or less flattened, and present no
trace of striæ or stripes, although the interior appears
granular, with an occasional nucleus. The heart is a remarkable
exception to this rule, being an involuntary organ,
with striped fibers differing in size, resembling in this respect
those of a voluntary muscle.</p>

<p>The peritoneal coat is formed of the white fibers, under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
structureless or basement membrane, covered by tesselated
epithelium, constituting a serous and secreting membrane.</p>

<p>376. Wounds and injuries of the abdomen are essentially
of three kinds&mdash;1. Affecting the paries or wall. 2. Opening
or extending into its cavity. 3. Wounding or injuring
its contents.</p>

<p>The wall of the belly is, when severely hurt, liable to a
permanent defect, as the ordinary result of a severe bruise.
It is the formation of a ventral rupture. A division of the
wall to any extent by a sharp-cutting instrument is usually
followed by a similar consequence; and it never fails to occur
in the openings made by a musket-ball penetrating into or
passing through the cavity.</p>

<p>Captain Tarleton, of the 7th or Royal Fusiliers, was
struck on the left iliac region by a large, flat piece of shell,
at the battle of Albuhera, in 1811. The surface was not
abraded, although the iron caused a very severe and painful
bruise; the whole of that side of the belly became quite
black, and the remaining part much discolored. Some
months afterward he drew my attention to the part, and I
then found that the whole of the muscular portion of the
wall had been removed by absorption to the extent of the
immediate injury from the piece of shell, the tendinous parts
alone remaining under the integuments. These protruded
on any effort, constituting a circular-shaped ventral rupture,
with a large base, which required the application of a pad
and bandage for its repression.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith, a deputy-purveyor, received a blow on the side
of the fore part of the belly from the end of a spanker-boom,
which knocked him down, and gave rise for some time to
much inconvenience. He showed the part to me in Lisbon,
in 1813, in consequence of the formation of a ventral hernia to
the extent of the spot originally injured. In neither of these
cases was such a result expected; no rupture of the fibers of
the muscles was distinguished at the time, and it was supposed
that the sufferers would recover without any permanent
defect. The absorption of the muscular fibers was
therefore a subsequent process; whether this result may or
may not be prevented in similar cases by a more active or a
longer-continued treatment, with the early application of a
retaining bandage, is yet to be ascertained. It may be that
some muscular fibers were actually ruptured and others
bruised in these cases; but the extent of the absorption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
was greater than the apparent injury would seem to have
warranted.</p>

<p>Abscesses form from neglected injuries of this kind, and
give rise to the most serious apprehensions of their bursting
into the cavity of the abdomen, which, however, they very
rarely do. The safety of the peritoneum and its capability
of affording sufficient resistance to the progress of the matter
through it seem to depend upon the strength of the fibrous
structure on its outer or muscular side; the inner or really
serous surface being very delicate, and offering but little
resistance to the application of any moderate degree of
force.</p>

<p>An officer, whose name I forget, was wounded at the
assault of Ciudad Rodrigo, in 1812, by a musket-ball, on
the left side and fore part of the abdomen, near the crest
of the ilium: it made a wound about four inches in length,
cutting away the muscles of the abdominal wall so deeply
as to lead to the exposure, and, as I feared, to the ulceration
of the peritoneum, when the sloughs should separate.
Under these circumstances, although not belonging to my
division, I took him with me from the field to the divisional
hospital at Aldea Gallega, some ten miles from the battlefield.
Granulations sprang up, however, from the bottom
and sides of the wound, which gradually closed in and healed
without further difficulty.</p>

<p>377. It has been supposed theoretically, to be a matter of
importance to discriminate between the orifice of entrance
of a ball passing through the abdomen or its wall, and that
of its exit. Practically speaking, it is a matter of indifference;
the part on which the ball impinges is usually distinguished
by a more circular and depressed appearance, while
the opening of exit more frequently resembles a tear or slit,
the edges of which are rather disposed to protrude.</p>

<p>A ball striking obliquely against the wall of the abdomen
has been said to run sometimes nearly round under the skin,
or between the muscles and the peritoneum, a proceeding
upon the recurrence of which little expectation need be
placed. It may, however, do something of the kind for a
considerable distance, passing even over or between the
spinous processes of the vertebra behind. In such cases,
when they actually occur, the course of the ball will usually
be marked by a line on the skin, more or less of a reddish-blue
color; and the constitutional alarm, if it should occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
at all, will subside early. A ball may, however, pass under
and between the muscular layers of the wall of the belly, (or
run nearer to the peritoneum for several inches,) giving rise
to great anxiety, until the sloughs have separated from the
openings of entrance and of exit, at which parts they prevail
to a greater extent than in the middle of the track of
the projectile. In some few instances an opening will require
to be made in the middle of this track or course of the ball,
for the evacuation of pus or of other extraneous matters
which may be detained in it.</p>

<p>When a ball lodges in the wall of the abdomen and is
deeply situated, it sometimes escapes notice, and when found
is often better left alone unless it prove troublesome. When
it approaches the surface, it may be removed if it cause inconvenience.
When removed after the lapse of twenty or
more years, I have found some dense cellular membrane
forming a sac around and adhering to the ball, which is
usually more or less flattened and irregular.</p>

<p>378. Injuries of the wall of the abdomen from cuts or
stabs affecting the muscular and tendinous parts are said to
be frequently troublesome, and even dangerous, from their
giving rise to pain, vomiting, and severe general derangement.
This only occurs when suppuration takes place, and,
from some accidental circumstance, the matter does not find
a ready exit, but collects between the muscles, or within or
under their aponeurotic sheaths. This is indicated by the
pain and swelling of the part, proceeding sometimes to the
formation of an abscess, which ought to be prevented, if
possible, by an early enlargement of the wound, so as to
remove the cause of irritation, and the obstacle to the free
discharge of the secreted matter. If the swelling should
become prominent in a more convenient situation than the
spot of injury, it should be opened at that part.</p>

<p>In these and in all other serious injuries of the abdomen,
the recumbent position, with a relaxed state of the muscles,
should be observed for several days at least. The antiphlogistic
plan of treatment should be fully enforced, especially
by leeching, bleeding, and spare diet, and in due time the
part should be supported by a proper bandage.</p>

<p>The late General Sir John Elley was wounded in the last
charge of heavy cavalry at Waterloo, by the point of a sabre,
which entered nearer the extremity of the ensiform cartilage
than the umbilicus, causing a wound about two inches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
length, penetrating the stomach. From this he recovered
in due time without any severe symptoms, but with a small
hernia of that organ, which remained until his death, giving
rise occasionally to some gastric inconvenience when he did
not keep a gentle pressure on it by a retaining bandage.</p>

<p>379. Severe blows, or contusions from falls or from the
concussion of foreign bodies, may give rise not only to injury
of the internal parts of the abdomen, followed by inflammation,
but to rupture of the hollow as well as of the more solid
and fixed viscera, and death.</p>

<p>William Fletcher, of the 18th Hussars, a healthy man,
thirty-seven years of age, received a kick from a horse,
immediately above the os pubis, on the 15th of April, 1810,
(about a league from Cartaxo, on the Tagus;) great tension
of the belly soon followed, with excessive pain and vomiting.
The pulse rose rapidly. He was bled to syncope twice
during the day, to the extent of sixteen ounces each time.
In the evening he was removed to Cartaxo, and taken into
hospital; the pain continued, accompanied by retching,
without much vomiting; the abdomen was constantly fomented
with hot water, and injection was thrown up, and
two ounces of infusion of senna with salts were given every
two hours. In spite, however, of the most active treatment,
he died on the 17th. On dissection, the peritoneum was
found to contain a large collection of fluid, partaking of a
fecal character; the bowels appeared to have suffered to
the greatest extent, and a laceration was discovered in the
ileum.</p>

<p>A child, just able to walk, was placed under my care in
the Westminster Hospital, in consequence of its having
received some injury on the side of the belly, from having
been tossed up into the air by its father with his right hand,
and caught in its descent in the crutch formed by the thumb
and fingers of the left, on the thumb of which it unfortunately
at last fell; this caused the child great pain, which was soon
followed by considerable swelling and inflammation of the
belly, of which it died. On examination after death, the
small intestine was discovered to have been ruptured by the
end of the thumb, from which extravasation of its contents
into the abdomen had ensued.</p>

<p>The first effect of a rupture of the intestine must be the
extravasation of such gas as may be contained in or secreted
from it, giving rise to the sudden swelling, as well as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
sudden effusion, of part of its contents, but which, from the
support of continuity, and of the general pressure of the
abdominal parietes, is perhaps more gradually poured out.
The rapid swelling and tension of the belly is perhaps then
a distinguishing symptom of a rupture of the intestines.</p>

<p>A Spanish soldier was brought to me, near the conclusion
of the battle of Toulouse, in consequence of having been
struck obliquely by a cannon-shot on the right side of the
abdomen and back, which appeared to be badly braised,
although no abrasion of the skin had taken place. The
shock was great, however; he was unable to move his
limbs, and appeared likely to die, which he did in fact, in
the course of the night, having passed bloody urine, but
without any reaction having taken place. On making an
incision through the skin, which was then quite a blue black,
although not torn, all the soft parts were found reduced to a
state approaching to the appearance of jelly; the spine was
injured, the right kidney ruptured, and the cavity of the
abdomen full of blood.</p>

<p>A soldier of the 40th Regiment was struck by a ricochet
cannon-shot, on the last day of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.
He saw the ball, which destroyed his left forearm so as to
render amputation necessary, strike the ground a little distance
from him, before he was himself injured. He thought,
from the sort of shock he received, that it had also struck
his belly; but this I should not have credited, if it had not
been for a bruise across the umbilical region without actual
abrasion of the integuments, on which account my attention
was drawn to him on the fourth day after the injury, at the
hospital of Aldea Gallega. He had been bled in consequence
of complaining of pain, and because of the quickness
of pulse and the fever which had ensued, and which were
attributed to irritation after amputation. The belly was
swollen and tender under pressure. Calomel, antimony, and
opium were given: he was bled again, and blisters were applied.
The stump took on unhealthy action, and he died a
fortnight after the receipt of the injury. The abdomen,
when opened, was found to contain a quantity of opaque
serous fluid, mixed with shreds of coagulable lymph. The
omentum and intestines were of a dark color, and loaded
with blood, distinctly indicating the chronic state of inflammation
which had taken place.</p>

<p>If the injury should not destroy the patient, but prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
sufficient to give rise, after several weeks, to effusion into
the cavity, the fluid should be evacuated by the trocar.</p>

<p>When the fixed viscera are ruptured by severe blows,
such as those received by falls or from cannon-shot, the sufferers
usually die from hemorrhage and not from inflammation.
The arm has been carried away, and the liver ruptured
without almost a sign of injury to the skin of the
abdomen, death ensuing from hemorrhage.</p>

<p>380. When an incised wound is made through the wall of
the abdomen to any extent, except perhaps in the linea alba,
the muscular parts are rarely found to unite in a more perfect
manner than when they are ruptured and bruised. In
those cases in which I have tied the common iliac artery by
an incision on the face of the lateral part of the abdomen,
the patients recovering afterward, the incision through the
muscular wall did not remain united, although union appeared
to have taken place in the first instance, and a herniary
protrusion formed in the course of the greater part of
the line of the wound.</p>

<p>The constant occurrence of this non-union, except by skin
and cellular membrane, led me to repudiate the introduction
of ligatures through other parts for the purpose of keeping
them in apposition, as it does not lead to the permanent cohesion
of the parts, while it exposes the sufferers to all the
dangers which the irritation of sutures commonly occasions,
thus offering another instance of the improvement surgery
owes to the war in the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Chelius recommends “several flat ligatures to be introduced
through the skin and muscles, the needle being placed
close to the muscular surface of the peritoneum.” Graëfe
(section 514) is declared to be of the same opinion, he recommending,
however, that a soft tape should be substituted
for a ligature. Reference is made to Weber in support of
this practice, to which Mr. South, the translator, does not
raise any objection.</p>

<p>381. In all simple wounds of the wall of the belly of moderate
extent, the edges of the wound should be brought
together by means of a small needle and a fine silk thread
passed through the skin and the loose cellular membrane
only which is in contact with it, by a continuous suture without
puckering, in the manner a tailor would fine-draw a hole
in a coat. This gives a certain degree of support to the
parts beneath; and if proper attention be paid to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
a well-regulated, relaxed position of the muscles, no great
separation takes place in wounds of a reasonable extent, and
little or none in a wound of smaller dimensions. An effective
support should be also given by strips of adhesive plaster
extending to some distance around the body; a bandage
rarely does good, and will assuredly do mischief, unless it be
very carefully applied and watched, so as only to give support
and not to make undue pressure. The position of the
patient is of the greatest importance; its essential object is
to bring the edges of the incision, and especially of that in
the peritoneum, as nearly as possible in apposition, so that
the space between them may be more easily filled up by
the opposing peritoneum forming the anterior layer of the
omentum, or by the outer covering of the intestine if the
omentum should not intervene. This is to be effected by
the gentlest inclination of the body toward the wound which
may be supposed capable of keeping these parts in apposition;
for although the omentum and intestines are often capable
of undergoing a considerable degree of motion from
side to side, independently of that peculiar wormlike movement
on themselves which in the intestines is called peristaltic,
they very frequently do not wander from place to
place in the manner which has been sometimes attributed to
them, but remain, under proper care, so far stationary as to
admit of the cut edges of the wounded peritoneum adhering
to the healthy peritoneum opposed to them, when they will
be retained in contact with it. The serous surfaces of the
peritoneum which are in contact with each other soon offer
on one part, and accept on the other, the process of adhesion
through the medium of lymph or fibrin deposited between
them. If this adhesion take place, it extends for
some little distance from the wounded part, which it thus
closes up and cuts off from all communication with the general
cavity of the belly; the previous admission of air&mdash;the
bugbear of surgeons of the olden times&mdash;being of no sort of
consequence. The adhesive process is the effect of inflammation
extending to a certain point, and ending in the deposition
of fibrin. When it exceeds this, the secretion of a
quantity of serous fluid, together with threads of flocculent
matter, marks the excess of inflammation; it is diffused over
more or less of the peritoneum lining the wall of the belly,
covers its contained viscera, and prevents that adhesion from
taking place which is the safeguard of the patient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
382. Absolute quietude is no less to be observed. It
must, however, be steadfastly continued; the slightest alteration
of position should be forbidden. Motion should not
on any account, nor for any reason whatever, be allowed, if
it can by any possibility be avoided. In the position in
which the patient is placed he should be rigorously maintained
until adhesion has been effected or all hope of it has
passed away. The practice of the older surgeons was to
purge such persons vigorously, in order to remove from
their bowels any peccant matters that might be in them; in
the same manner they recommended persons should be
purged who had undergone the operation for strangulated
hernia&mdash;both which proceedings the experience of the war
enabled me to condemn, as being not only contrary to the
right medical treatment of such cases, but to the physiological
and surgical principles on which it ought to be founded,
a condemnation the accuracy of which is now universally admitted,
although the source from which it is derived is not
so universally acknowledged. No purgative medicine whatever
should be given to a person with a penetrating wound
of the abdomen. No food should enter his mouth; and no
more water even should be allowed than may be found requisite
to moisten the lips and allay any intolerable thirst which
may ensue. This precaution need not be carried out so
strictly if it could be readily ascertained that an intestine
was not wounded; but as this knowledge, however satisfactory
it would be, cannot always be obtained, and ought
not in the generality of instances to be sought for, the restriction
should be fully observed if possible. In all cases
of injury of the belly there is more or less shock, alarm, and
anxiety. It is sometimes remarkably great, even when the
mischief has not been considerable. When little or no injury
has been inflicted on the intestines, the natural and
usual action of expelling the contents is generally delayed
beyond the time at which in health it would in all probability
have occurred. When nature shall point out by the sensations
of the patient an inclination to perform this function,
it may be assisted by an injection of warm water or of any
mild laxative which may facilitate the process and prevent
any unnecessary action of the abdominal muscles, against
which the patient should be cautioned. The attendants
should be forewarned that the position of the patient is not
to be interfered with under any circumstances, the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
arrangements being made by bedsteads of a proper construction,
or by other simple means which are sufficiently
well known.</p>

<p>383. The custom of directing a man to be bled forthwith,
as well as purged, because he has been stabbed, was another
error much in esteem by the older surgeons, but which experience
did not sanction, and it could not therefore be approved.
The abstraction of blood before reaction has taken
place delays its occurrence as well as the commencement of
that inflammatory stage which is to be so salutary in its result
in favorable cases. It tends to prevent the agglutinative
process from taking place, and thus aids the diffusion
of inflammation over the whole surface of the peritoneum.
The general abstraction of blood is to be ordered, and regulated
as to quantity by the symptoms of inflammation which
may accompany or follow reaction. The quantity of blood
required to be taken away in these cases is usually large,
particularly at an early period. With the army in the Crimea,
the abstraction of large quantities could not in general
be borne and has not been found serviceable, nor has it been
found so necessary to repeat the bleedings as in persons
more favorably situated. It is, however, often a nice point
to determine when blood enough has been abstracted with
advantage, as too much may be taken away as well as too
little&mdash;the former being marked, after death, by the general
diffusion of a slight degree of inflammation, without the
concomitant sign of effusion of serum. Leeches applied in
considerable number will often be found more beneficial, particularly
at a late period, when the sufferer may not be able
to bear a general abstraction of blood. The patient, after
leeches have been once applied and their good effect has
been ascertained, will often ask for them himself on the recurrence
of pain or on its increase; and from twenty to sixty,
or even eighty, may be applied in some instances of great
danger with advantage.</p>

<p>The pulse is by no means a guide in the management of
these cases; a small, low, and sometimes not even a hard
pulse being more strongly indicative of an overpowering
state of inflammation than is a quick and full pulse; much
more depends on the pain, the anxiety, and the general oppression
than on the apparent state of the circulation. Before
general and local bleeding cease to be employed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
advantage, calomel, antimony, and opium will render essential,
nay, most important, service.</p>

<p>The extensive incisions made of late years into the abdomen
for the removal of ovarian tumors, with fair success,
confirm what I have constantly repeated in my lectures for
the last thirty-five years, that penetrating wounds of the
abdomen, without injury to the viscera, when properly
treated, are not so dangerous as they were generally supposed
to be.</p>

<p>384. In penetrating wounds of the belly, the offending
instrument frequently passes in for a considerable distance,
sometimes separating or pushing the viscera aside without
injuring them, at others inflicting upon them wounds more
or less severe. In fatal cases of stabs from knives and
sharp instruments, the intestines have been usually injured
by the point, although when the lapse of three or four days
before death takes place, the small wound is not readily
perceived.</p>

<p>W. Carpenter, private, 1st battalion, 43d Regiment, was
accidentally wounded, March 19th, 1812, by a comrade, the
small end of a ramrod entering about two inches below the
navel, passing in a direction upward, penetrating the second
lumbar vertebra, and protruding an inch and a half on the
opposite side.</p>

<p>On examining the wound, the ramrod was found firmly
fixed in the bone. It was endeavored at first to extract it
by a gentle turn, making extension at the same time, but
this failed. Force was then applied on the opposite side,
by fixing the broad end of a ramrod on the point of the
protruding one, which was laid bare by an incision, when by
a smart stroke with a stone it was driven back and removed.
Bleeding to twenty ounces.</p>

<p>March 20th.&mdash;Has slept several hours during the night;
passed urine two or three times; suffers slight pain occasionally
on turning himself in bed; has the perfect use of
his lower extremities; pulse rather full; skin cool; repeat
bleeding to twenty ounces.</p>

<p>22d.&mdash;No evacuation since the 20th; pulse rather full;
bleeding to twenty-two ounces; sulphate of magnesia, one
ounce. Seven o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: Medicine operated three or
four times; feels no pain in passing water.</p>

<p>23d.&mdash;Has passed a good night; wounds dressed; is allowed
a small proportion of bread with his tea.</p>

28th.&mdash;So far recovered as to be able to be removed to
Elvas.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>That a blunt instrument, like the small end of a ramrod,
should be forced between the loose viscera of the abdomen
without wounding any of them, may be easily conceived,
but that balls or sharp-pointed swords should do so, is not to
be understood so easily. Ambrose Paré, our own Wiseman,
Ravaton, Lamotte, Muys, and others, however, have related
instances of this kind, in which the patients recovered in an
inconceivably short space of time; but these and other recoveries
of a similar nature must be considered as exceptions
to general rule.</p>

<p>385. Wounds penetrating the wall of the belly, when
made by cutting or lacerating instruments, or by musket-balls,
are usually followed, if to any extent, by a protrusion
of some portion of the contents of the cavity, generally of
the omentum or intestine, if not of both. This may take
place at the rounded orifice of entrance of a ball, as well as
at the more slit-like opening of exit, which, if the patient
should recover, becomes closed by a thin tendinous-like expansion,
under the cicatrix formed by the common integuments.
These soon yield to the general pressure on the
abdominal cavity, and admit of the formation at the part of
a ventral rupture, requiring the application of a restraining
bandage.</p>

<p>386. When a piece of omentum only protrudes, the direction
given by the latest writers on surgery is, that it shall be
returned into the cavity of the abdomen whence it came, the
finger following to ascertain that it is quite free; after which
the wound is to be carefully closed by sutures applied close
to the peritoneum, so that the omentum may not again protrude
through it. Having objected already to the manner
of employing the suture, I now object to the treatment of
the omentum, and do not approve of its being so dextrously
returned by the finger within the peritoneum to its natural
loose situation. I desire, on the contrary, that it may be
retained between the cut edges of the peritoneum, but without
the slightest pressure or possible strangulation, in order
that by its retention it may more readily adhere to these
edges, and thus form a more certain barrier against the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>tension
of inflammation than is likely to take place when
moving at liberty in the cavity of the abdomen, however
closely it may be supposed to be applied to the inner surface
of its paries.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a portion of omentum is altogether
without the cavity of the abdomen, and the opening
through which it has protruded seems too small to allow its
restoration to the cavity. The latest authors on this subject
recommend a blunt director to be introduced between
the upper edge of the wound and the protruded part, be it
omentum or intestine, or both, upon which a blunt-ended
bistoury is to be passed into the cavity as far as the enlargement
of the wound seems to require, after which the director
and the bistoury are to be withdrawn together. I altogether
dissent from this. It is scarcely ever necessary to enlarge
the opening in the peritoneum, the obstacle to reduction
being situated in the tendinous expansion or aponeurosis of
the wall of the belly, a slight division of which will give
sufficient space for the restoration of the protruded part in
almost every instance. I have unavoidably opened into the
cavity of the peritoneum, and have seen it done in other instances,
but no inconvenience follows small openings not exceeding
a quarter of an inch in length, when they are properly
covered over by the healthy parts. It is therefore important
in all cases to have as small an opening as possible
in the peritoneum, and certainly no addition should be made
to the size of a small opening if it can by any possibility be
avoided, however indifferent half an inch, more or less, may
be in the length of a large one. All protruded parts, whether
omentum or intestine, should be gently cleansed with warm
water, and the fingers of the surgeon should be wetted in a
similar manner, the mesentery being returned first if protruded,
then the intestine, and lastly the omentum; the two
former under all circumstances; the latter not so, if it be
adherent or inflamed, torn or jagged, or in a state of suppuration
or gangrene. It should in these cases be left to
itself, and treated in the most simple manner; a ligature
should never be applied to it, neither should it be spread out
and cut off, as was formerly recommended, as it will gradually
retract and be withdrawn into the cavity of the abdomen.
If suppuration should take place in its substance,
and the swelling of the part lead to its constriction, or the
formation of matter under the integuments or between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
layers of muscular or tendinous fibers, these may be carefully
divided.</p>

<p>Evan Thomas, aged seventeen, was admitted into the
Westminster Hospital, Sept. 1st, 1828, having been stabbed
with a dinner-knife immediately above the umbilicus; the
wound was three-quarters of an inch long; the omentum
protruded and could not be returned until the skin, cellular
membrane, and fascia had been divided; the opening in the
peritoneum was then distinctly seen, against the inside of
which the omentum was left, the wound in the skin being
sewed up by the continuous suture. In the evening he was
bled to sixteen ounces, and, as he had thrown up his dinner,
an enema only was administered. On the 2d, the belly being
tense and slightly painful, although he was not in constant
pain, the blood drawn before being buffy, twenty-two ounces
more were taken away, a purgative enema administered, and,
as the bowel was not believed to be injured, four grains of
calomel and six of the compound extract of colocynth were
given, with a draught of senna and salts every four hours.
3d. The bowels open; no pain and scarcely any uneasiness
on pressure; abdomen soft. No food; barley-water and
gruel; pulse 84. On the 6th the sutures were removed, the
wound having reunited. He was then made an out-patient,
having a comfortable home.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Second Division of Infantry received
several stabs from a lance in different parts of the body, at
the battle of Albuhera, as the lancers rode past him, while
lying on the ground, one only being of any importance: it
was on the right side and lower part of the belly, and
through it a portion of omentum protruded. On this being
reduced, the epigastric artery, which had been divided, bled
freely; a ligature was readily applied, and the wound closed
by the continuous suture. The patient, after undergoing a
very rigorous treatment, recovered.</p>

<p>A Spanish soldier was wounded in a scuffle in Madrid, in
1812, at the gate of the British Hospital, near the Prado,
into which he was brought, with a wound on the right side
of the abdomen, near and below the umbilicus, through
which a portion of omentum protruded about the size of
a small orange. As this could not readily be returned, I
carefully enlarged the wound at its under part, some three
or four hours afterward, by dividing the skin, and then
found that it was the aponeurotic or tendinous expansion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
the muscles going to form the sheath of the rectus, which
prevented the return of the omentum into the belly; on the
division of this part it slipped back without difficulty, but as
it did not recede further than the peritoneum I left it there,
and closed the wound, which was about an inch long, by
sewing it up in the manner described. He was bled and
starved, and was delivered up to the proper authorities out
of danger, with his wound nearly healed, when the army
evacuated the place.</p>

<p>A Spanish soldier was wounded at the battle of Toulouse
by a musket-ball, which passed in on one side and came out
at the other, carrying with it a portion of omentum which
gradually became as large as an orange, in which state I
saw it four days after the accident. Little had been done;
he had not suffered much pain, although the abdomen was
tender; he had vomited; passed blood with his motions;
was feverish and ill. I visited this man every three or four
days; he suffered from privations of every kind, yet each
time I found him better. The protruded omentum gradually
diminished in size, and was at last drawn into the wound in
the abdomen and covered by granulations. He left Toulouse
before me, nearly well.</p>

<p>If the omentum be greatly bruised or injured it may be
cut off, and the vessels tied if bleeding; but it should not
be returned further than the edges of the peritoneum, over
which the external wound is to be closed.</p>

<p>Ravaton wrote a hundred years ago: “The views of a
surgeon must be very confined who advises the application
of a ligature to the omentum when protruding from the
cavity of the belly in a healthy state. It is a cruel and
deadly maneuver, contrary to reason and experience. To
restore it to its place is so simple, just, and reasonable, that
I am surprised it does not occur to every one. The reduction
is easily effected. It is sometimes difficult to retain the
reduced part except by sutures. I admit that when the
omentum is strangulated, gorged with blood, black, and
about to become gangrenous, the result of its restoration to
the cavity may be doubted: yet experience has demonstrated
that it is the safest mode of proceeding, taking care not to
close the wound entirely, but to leave an opening at the
lower part to give vent to any effusion or suppuration that
may take place.”</p>

<p>387. When a portion of intestine is protruded without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
being wounded, it is to be returned, whatever may be its
state, unless it be soft and unresisting between the fingers, of
a dull blue or black color, and to every surgical eye deprived
of life or mortified. At any state previous to this (to Englishmen)
almost certainly fatal condition, it should be restored
into the cavity of the abdomen. When a portion of intestine
is thus returned, three directions are given by most modern
surgeons, and especially by Chelius, section 517, on which
his English editor makes no comment; and which may therefore
be considered to be those which are commonly taught
in London, but of which I entirely disapprove. The first is,
that the peritoneum is to be divided in cases where an obstacle
is interposed to the return of the intestine; this I aver to
be less necessary for the intestine than for the omentum. The
second is that, “after the reduction, the forefinger must be
introduced into the cavity of the belly in order to ascertain
that the intestines have not passed into the interspaces of the
muscles”&mdash;a precaution which is unnecessary, and may do
much mischief. The third is, that the patient is then to be
placed “in such a posture as that the intestines should least
press against the wound,” to which direction I object. The
surgeon should certainly take care that the intestine does
not pass between the layers of muscle, nor anywhere else
than into the cavity of the belly. So far, however, from the
intestines being pushed away from the cut peritoneum, the
most favorable position for it would be to be applied against
the edges of the cut membrane, and even rising up for the
least possible distance, without or above it, the great object
to be desired being to facilitate adhesion by as perfect an
apposition of these parts as possible, while the external
wound is accurately closed by the continuous suture, and
duly supported by adhesive plaster, compress, and a bandage,
provided it be methodically applied. The next best thing
which can happen is that, every part being relaxed, and the
patient perfectly quiescent, the intestine should press so
steadily and yet so gently against the wounded peritoneum
that it will be kept in constant apposition with it without
protruding through it.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Artillery was stabbed in two places, in
1812, with a long knife, by a townsman, late in the evening,
and was carried into the hospital for the sick and wounded
French prisoners in Lisbon. The wound in the belly was
situated somewhat more than an inch to the right side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
the umbilicus, and was about an inch in length from above
downward; through it a considerable protrusion of small
intestine, without any omentum, had taken place. This was
distended by flatus, and of a dark-brown color when I first
saw it, some time after the receipt of the injury. The bowel
being constricted by the tendinous expansion of the muscular
fibers, the latter was carefully divided by a blunt-pointed
curved bistoury passed under its upper edge, and resting on
the back of the nail of the forefinger, by which the intestine
was guarded; the flatus having been pressed out of the intestine,
which was gently washed with warm water, it was
restored to the cavity of the abdomen. Of the part which
had apparently first protruded, the peritoneal coat and a few
fibers of the longitudinal layer of muscle were divided to the
extent of half an inch, the remaining portion of the gut being
unhurt. The skin was then sewed up by a fine continuous
suture, and adhesive plaster and a compress duly applied.
A good deal of alarm was evinced, the pulse was very small,
and the man faint. The other wound was in the back, about
half an inch in extent, and near the inferior angle of the right
scapula. It appeared to be a penetrating wound, but not
giving rise to any peculiar symptoms, he was placed in bed
on his back, with his legs raised, and the body slightly bent.
Early the next morning, the officer on duty found it necessary
to bleed him largely, to forty ounces, according to my
directions, on account of pain which had come on in his
bowels and in his back, accompanied by difficulty of breathing,
the skin being hot and the pulse quick and hard. The
cellular membrane around the wound in the back was emphysematous;
there was a slight cough, accompanied by an
expectoration slightly tinged with blood. The bleeding removed
the essential symptoms, but the pain and difficulty of
breathing returning next day, it was repeated to eighteen
ounces, with an equally good effect. It was necessary to
repeat it on the third, fourth, and fifth days, when the pain
ceased to return, and the pulse, instead of being small and
hard, became softer and fuller. The bowels were open naturally
on the third day, and the emphysema had gradually
disappeared, no food being allowed, and very little drink for
some days, and then only in small quantities of the simplest
kind. The threads were removed with scissors on the sixth
day, and the man was free from complaint, although very
weak, at the end of five weeks.</p>

<p>Madame Doucet was applied to a hundred years ago, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
soldier, who having been struck by a halbert, had a wound
made across his abdomen from above the ilium, through
which a quantity of intestine protruded, which he carried in
his hat, enveloped in his shirt. Having had to walk between
three and four miles, in the heat of July, to the old lady,
his bowels were as dry as parchment by the time he arrived.
She therefore bathed them in warm milk and water until
they became soft and natural in appearance, returned them
into the cavity of the belly, and sewed up the wound with a
well-waxed silken thread&mdash;thus setting an example which
ought to be followed in 1855. The man recovered.</p>

<p>388. When the protruded intestine is wounded, the case
is complicated, and much depends on the size of the wound.
A mere puncture, or a very small cut, is often of no consequence,
and does not require any treatment; the bowel
should merely be returned to the cavity of the belly, and the
symptoms of inflammation closely watched, and, if possible,
steadily subdued.</p>

<p>It is advisable, in investigating this subject further, to consider
the abdomen as devoid of cavity during life and health,
the contained parts being so gently pressed upon by the containing
and retaining muscular parietes around as to enable
them all to carry on their ordinary functions, unless suffering
from some derangement, exclusive of that which might arise
from a deficiency of the pressure usually exercised upon them;
but that this pressure can, or generally will, prevent the effusion
of the contents of a bowel when ruptured, if the wound
be half an inch in length, or that it will prevent the extravasation
of blood from an artery or vein of moderate dimensions,
if torn, is contrary to facts now considered indisputable,
as I have frequently had occasion to verify. That a
mere puncture of the intestine does not allow the effusion of
air, much less of the contents of the bowel, is not doubted.
When the contents of the bowel have been poured out, without
an external opening in the paries through which they
might escape, inflammation and death have ensued at no long
distance of time. When blood is poured out from the great
vessels, as in rupture of the liver or spleen&mdash;of which instances
will be adduced&mdash;the general cavity may be filled;
but when the injury is less extensive, or the lesion less important,
the blood usually gravitates toward the back or
sinks into the pelvis. It is possible that blood may be effused
in small quantity, and be then confined, under the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
pressure of the wall of the abdomen and the resistance offered
by its contents, to a particular spot, whence it may be absorbed
after coagulation; or, by commencing decomposition,
give rise to irritation, and be discharged through the external
wound, if one exist, or through the bowel with which it
may happily be in contact.</p>

<p>A soldier, belonging to the Second Division of Infantry,
was wounded by the Polish Lancers at the battle of Albuhera,
in several places slightly, and in the abdomen severely,
a penetrating wound having been made an inch long, between
the umbilicus and the crest of the ilium on the left side.
Brought to me the day after at Valverde, the edges of the
wound were stitched together and dressed simply. He said
it had bled freely at first, and was then painful. Treated
antiphlogistically and sharply, the inflammatory symptoms
gradually subsided. The bowels were relieved by gentle
aperients, there being no reason to suppose they had been
wounded. A small, oval swelling was soon perceived under
the wound, which was tender to the touch, indicating mischief
of some kind. The edges of the wound, which did not
unite fully, although they were retained in contact, at last
separated, and allowed about a wineglassful of bloody
matter to pass out, which reduced the swelling and removed
the uneasiness and pain of which he complained. After this
he gradually recovered, and was discharged to Elvas, and
thence to Lisbon.</p>

<p>389. Whenever large effusions of blood have occurred, the
sufferers have usually been lost, from the occurrence of peritoneal
inflammation. That small ones may be absorbed, cannot
be doubted. I have seen instances of their having been
discharged by the bowel, although I have never been so fortunate
as to see a general formation of matter from effusion,
and to have opened the abdomen for the evacuation of its
contents with success; nevertheless, I do contemplate that
such cases may occur, and surgery may come to their relief
with good effect.</p>

<p>The important conclusions to be deduced from the observations
of those who have made experiments on the intestines
of living animals are&mdash;First, that wounds not exceeding
four lines in length, (or the third part of an inch,) no matter
what their direction may be, are not so apt, as might be
supposed, if left to themselves, to be succeeded by extravasation
of the contents of the intestinal tube; and that, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
majority of cases, nature, properly aided by art, is fully competent
to effect reparation. Secondly, that wounds of the
bowels to the extent of six lines, whether transverse, oblique,
or longitudinal, are almost always, if not invariably, followed
by the escape of the contents of the bowel, and the consequent
development of fatal peritonitis. It may, therefore,
be concluded, from experiments made on animals, as far as
they can be relied upon with reference to man, that every
wound in the bowel, of such an extent as shall not admit of
its being temporarily filled up by the protrusion and eversion
of its internal or mucous coat, which always takes place as
an effort of nature to close the wound, ought, if possible, to
receive assistance from art, and that can only be given with
advantage in the first instance.</p>

<p>Mr. Travers tied a thin ligature firmly round the duodenum
of a living dog; the ends were cut off, the parts returned,
and the external wound properly closed. On the fifteenth
day, the cure being completed, the dog was killed. A portion
of omentum, connected with the duodenum, was lying
within the wound, and the folds contiguous to the tied part
of the intestine adhered to it in several points. A slight
depression was observed around the duodenum, the internal
or mucous surface of which was more vascular than usual;
a transverse fissure marked the seat of the ligature. “The
lymph,” Dr. Gross observes, “which is effused upon the external
surface of a bowel, consequent upon such an operation,
gives the part at first a rough, uneven appearance; but, if
the animal survive several months, it is generally no easy
matter to determine the seat of the injury from the external
appearance of the part. Internally, the cicatrization is
almost as complete, the continuity of the mucous membrane
being everywhere established, leaving scarcely even a seam
at the original seat of constriction. The rapid manner in
which the ligature cuts its way from without inward obviates
the evils which might arise from the occlusion of the passage.
In an experiment, in which the dog was killed upon the
eleventh day after the application of the ligature, the canal
of the bowel was completely restored, and the bond of connection
between the divided parts was firm and organized.”</p>

<p>Similar effects are produced when a small ligature is applied
around the edges of a wound from two to three lines
in diameter, provided it be drawn with sufficient firmness not
to slip off. The process of reparation is not, however, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
speedily completed, owing to the breach being much wider
than when a ligature is simply placed around the tube. The
mucous membrane requires a longer period for its reproduction,
and the quantity of lymph deposited around and
inclosing the ligature is proportionally greater.</p>

<p>390. The idea of sewing together, and thereby restoring
the continuity of a wounded bowel, is attributed to four
master surgeons, as they were called, of Paris, in the thirteenth
century, who, having united their efforts for the relief
of the sick poor in that city, procured, it is said, a portion of
the trachea of an animal, one end of which they introduced
into the upper part of the divided bowel, and the remaining
piece into the lower, and then brought the divided ends into
contact, and retained them by as many sutures as appeared
to be necessary. Their writings, in which this operation is
described, are lost. Peter de Argelata, who lived about the
middle of the fifteenth century, says that Jemerius, Roger,
and Theodoric supported the intestine by a canula of elder-wood,
while Gilbert de Salicetti condemns both the use of
the trachea and the elder-wood tube, and recommends, if
anything be used, that it should be the dry and hardened
bowel of some animal. These ancient surgeons believed that
a transverse division of the intestine was necessarily a fatal
injury, and only resorted to the methods they recommended
when the division was less complete. Duverger de Maubeuge,
in the beginning of the eighteenth century, apparently
unaware of what had been done before his time, brought forward
this method of the four masters as an invention of his
own. He cut off a portion of mortified intestine in a case of
strangulated hernia, introduced a piece of the trachea of a
calf, brought the divided intestine over it, and fastened it by
a suture. The trachea was passed on the twenty-first day,
and the external wound was closed by the forty-fifth, the
patient recovering.</p>

<p>Ramdohr, a German surgeon, who lived in the early part
of the last century, seems to have been the first to join the
ends of a divided bowel by introducing the upper end within
the lower. He removed two feet of mortified intestine in a
case of strangulated hernia&mdash;performed this operation on the
ends of the bowel, retained the parts by stitches, and his
patient perfectly recovered. Heister says the mortified parts
were in his possession. (Haller, <i>Disputat. Anatom.</i>, vol. vi.,
<i>Observ. Med. Miscel.</i>, 18.) Since his time, many of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
eminent surgeons of France, Italy, America, and Great Britain
have turned their attention to this subject; but the conclusion
at which I have arrived is that the continuous suture is,
in all cases of serious injury, the most simple and the best.</p>

<p>391. In making a continuous suture, a fine needle and a
waxed silken thread should be introduced through the gut,
beginning on the inside close to one end of the cut part,
and bringing it out on the peritoneal surface a little more
than a line distant from where it entered. The needle is
then to be carried to the opposite side through the bowel
from without inward, and the sewing thus continued until
completed, each stitch being about the sixth part of an inch
asunder, and about that distance from the edge of the cut.
The threads or stitches should not be drawn close until the
whole are inserted, when, on being drawn moderately tight
one after another, the cut edge of the intestine should be
turned inward by a blunt probe, so that the peritoneal surfaces
shall be in contact under the stitches and in the best
situation for union, the mucous coat forming a ridge within,
the outside being perfectly smooth, the stitches not being too
tight, while the end may be secured by a knot made by a
turn of the thread over the needle. This done, the intestine
should be returned into the cavity of the abdomen, and
events awaited. Recoveries more frequently follow wounds
of the colon than of the jejunum or ilium; but the result
must always be doubtful, being dependent on many causes
which the surgeon can neither foresee nor control.</p>

<p class="h2sub">TREATMENT OF INCISED WOUNDS, ETC.</p>

<p>392. When an incised wound in the intestine is not supposed
to exceed a third of an inch in length, no interference
should take place; for the nature and extent of the injury
cannot always be ascertained without the committal of a
greater mischief than the injury itself. When the wound in
the external parts has been made by an instrument not larger
than one-third or from that to half an inch in width, no attempt
to probe or to meddle with the wound, for the pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>pose
of examining the intestine, should be permitted. When
the external wound has been made by a somewhat broader
and longer instrument, it does not necessarily follow that the
intestine should be wounded to an equal extent; and unless
it protrude, or the contents of the bowel be discharged
through the wound, the surgeon will not be warranted in
enlarging the wound in the first instance to see what mischief
has been done. It may be argued that a wound four
inches long has been proved to be oftentimes as little dangerous
as a wound one inch in length; yet most people
would prefer having the smaller wound, unless it could be
believed that the intestine was injured to a considerable extent.
Few surgeons, even then, would like to enlarge the
wound to ascertain the fact, unless some considerable bleeding
or a discharge of fecal matter pointed out the necessity
for such an operation. When the wounded bowel protrudes,
or the external opening is sufficiently large to enable the
surgeon to see or feel the injury by the introduction of his
finger, there should be no difficulty as to the mode of proceeding.</p>

<p>393. A puncture or cut which is filled up by the mucous
coat so as to be apparently impervious to air does not demand
a ligature. An opening which does not appear to be
so well filled up as to prevent air and fluids from passing
through it cannot usually be less than two lines in length,
and should be treated by suture. When the opening is
small, a tenaculum may be pushed through both the cut
edges, and a small silk ligature passed around, below the
tenaculum, so as to include the opening in a circle, a mode
of proceeding I have adopted with success in wounds of the
internal jugular vein without impairing its continuity; or
the opening, if larger, may be closed by two or more continuous
stitches made with a very fine needle and silk thread,
cut off in both methods close to the bowel, the removal of
which from the immediate vicinity of the external wound is
little to be apprehended under favorable circumstances.
The threads or sutures will be carried into the cavity of the
bowel, as has been already stated, if the person survive, and
the external part of the wounded bowel will either adhere
to the abdominal peritoneum or to one or other of the
neighboring parts.</p>

<p>When the intestine is more largely injured in a longitudinal
or transverse direction, or is completely divided as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
as or beyond the mesentery, the continuous suture is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>394. When the abdomen has been penetrated, and considerable
bleeding takes place, but not from the intestine,
it is necessary to look for the wounded vessel. When it
comes from one of the mesenteric arteries or from the epigastric,
the wound is to be enlarged until the bleeding artery
be exposed, when ligatures are to be placed on its divided
ends if they both bleed, the external wound being accurately
closed. I have seen the epigastric artery tied several times
with success.</p>

<p>A Portuguese caçador on picket was wounded at the second
siege of Badajos in a sally made by some French cavalry.
He had three or four trifling cuts on the head and
shoulders, and one across the lower part of the belly on the
right side. He bled profusely, and, when brought to me,
had lost a considerable quantity of blood which came through
a small wound made by the point of a sabre. This wound
I enlarged until the wounded but undivided artery became
visible; upon this two ligatures were placed, and the external
wound was sewed up. The peritoneum was open to a
small extent, but the bowel did not protrude; and the patient
(not being an Englishman, and therefore not so liable
to inflammation) recovered after being sent to Elvas.</p>

<p>A soldier of the same regiment, cut down at the same
time, died as soon as he was brought into camp, having been
severely wounded in the chest and abdomen. He was said
to have died from hemorrhage, from a wound in the belly,
two inches in length, made by one of the long-pointed
swords of the French dragoons. I had the curiosity to enlarge
the wound, and found one of the small intestines had
been cut half across, another part injured, and that the blood
came from an artery which had been opened by the point of
the sword in going through the mesentery, which wound had
caused his death.</p>

<p>395. When this operation cannot be done successfully or
with advantage to the patient, whose life is in jeopardy from
the continued drain, the wound should be closed by suture,
and a compress laid over it and retained by a bandage methodically
applied for the purpose of aiding the muscular
parietes in keeping up that pressure on the viscera which
may be useful in arresting the flow of blood from the wounded
part. If the bleeding continue, or, having been arrested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
should recur, and the belly become in consequence distended,
the sutures being evidently so tense as to be likely to cut
their way out, or if the blood should ooze out between the
stitches, they may be in part removed in order to give immediate
relief. When the belly becomes very painful, tense,
and manifestly full after a punctured wound, and not tympanitic
from the extrication of air or the distention of the bowel
by it, the wound should be enlarged to allow the evacuation
of the extravasated blood, which cannot be absorbed when
in such quantity. The orifice of a small gunshot wound,
which is not sufficiently direct to communicate with the cavity
and to allow the issue of blood extravasated in the quantity
alluded to, should be enlarged to such an extent as to
effect that object.</p>

<p>396. Blood effused in moderate quantity, and circumscribed
by the pressure exercised upon the contents of the
abdomen by its parietes, may readily be evacuated by the
wound, provided it be sufficiently open; and the patient
may recover, if the inflammation which must necessarily
ensue should not be communicated along the peritoneum
throughout the cavity, or if it should be subdued in time.
If the blood be in small quantity, it coagulates, and may be
absorbed; but if in such a quantity as cannot be absorbed,
or from any other cause which may prevent its removal by
this means, it becomes after a time a source of irritation,
and nature sometimes commences early to cut it off from the
general cavity by surrounding it with fibrin&mdash;a result which,
however desirable, can rarely be expected.</p>

<p>When extravasated blood is thus cut off from the general
cavity, and cannot be absorbed or be by accident carried off
through an opening in the bowel, a change takes place by
which it ceases to be bland and harmless, and causes it to
excite inflammation and its ordinary consequence, suppuration,
if the patient survive so long. This occurs, for the
most part, after the first inflammatory symptoms have subsided,
from the tenth to the twelfth, or even to a later, day,
when the renewal of irritation is accompanied by an increase
of the general symptoms, by a more local pain, and by a circumscribed
swelling of some part near the wound, in which
fluctuation may perhaps be distinguished even during the
existence of the general tenderness of the whole abdomen.
Under such circumstances, when it is proposed to make an
incision into this part, if it should be thought advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
do such an operation, it may safely be preceded by an exploring
needle or a very fine trocar and canula, which will
demonstrate the fact of the purulent and sanious depot,
without doing in such a case perhaps any mischief, if the
expectations of the surgeon should not be realized. If the
exploring needle should show that a bloody, purulent, or
other fluid is really distending the abdomen, no doubt ought
to be entertained about enlarging the original wound and
making a depending opening.</p>

<p>Ravaton, in his twenty-fifth observation, relates the case
of a soldier who was wounded five days before by the point
of a sabre, to the right of the umbilicus. When the man
was brought to him, the belly was swollen, hard, and very
painful, with vomiting, hiccough, etc., announcing the approach
of death. Believing that the abdomen contained a
fluid, either effused or secreted, he made an opening into the
cavity immediately above Poupart’s ligament or the outside
of the internal opening of the ring of the right side, when,
finding that nothing came from the cavity, he passed his
finger upward along the iliac vessels, and, after tearing up
some membranous adhesions, evacuated a pint of coagulated
blood and fetid, serous fluid. He then introduced a dossil
of lint into the wound to keep it open, fomented and oiled
the belly, round which he applied a bandage, and placed the
patient on his face. The bad symptoms diminished during
the night, and the patient declared himself better in the
morning. From the fifth to the tenth day of the wound he
was in extreme danger. On the eleventh, the bed was inundated
with a purulent matter of an almost insupportable
smell. The cavity of the abdomen was injected and cleansed,
the ordinary dressings applied, and the greatest cleanliness
observed. He was subsequently dressed three times a day
in a similar manner; portions of omentum were occasionally
drawn away with the forceps. His strength was well supported
by every kind of nourishment. The night-sweats
continued until the thirty-third day, and on the seventy-second
he was discharged from the hospital, cured. The
discharge at first was serous, and only became purulent on
the sixth day after the operation.</p>

<p>Thomas M’Mahon, 76th Regiment, aged twenty-two, was
admitted into the Garrison Hospital, Portsmouth, upon the
13th of June, 1845, with all the symptoms of strangulated
inguinal hernia of the left side, of two days’ standing, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
which the usual operation was performed. Everything went
on favorably till the morning of the fourth day after the
operation, when he made a sudden effort to go to the close-stool,
which was immediately followed by the descent of a
considerable portion of intestine and omentum, accompanied
with profuse hemorrhage from a small artery on the surface
of the intestine, which was taken up and tied, and the parts
returned into the abdominal cavity. The greatest excitement
followed, with all the symptoms of acute inflammation.
These were treated by general bleeding to the extent of fifty
ounces, and sixty leeches to the abdomen, with other antiphlogistic
remedies. On the morning of the seventeenth
day from the performance of the operation, a piece of intestine
came away with the fecal contents of the bowels,
after which the patient experienced relief in all his symptoms,
and appeared to gain health and strength, and after a
time the wound seemed disposed to close, three weeks after
the sloughing of the intestine. On the sixth day afterward
the evacuations ceased, attended with acute tenderness of
the abdomen, which began to swell fast. The means adopted
had not the slightest effect, and the patient was considered
past relief, unless it could be obtained by an external opening.
I accordingly made an incision over the site of the
former wound, and carefully opened the intestine, to the extent
only to allow the tube of the stomach-pump to be inserted,
when there was an immediate discharge of flatus and
some feculent matter, and the patient expressed himself relieved.
By the further use of the stomach-pump apparatus,
I was enabled to extract a quantity of feculent matter by
the artificial opening, and after some hours the patient was
completely relieved from the dangerous symptoms he was
suffering from. The artificial opening was left patent for
two months, when the bowels again gave evidence of acting
naturally. The artificial wound was not, however, closed
till the 22d of August, 1845; a week after the bowels appeared
to act freely and naturally.</p>

<p>The patient from this time got well and strong, and was
discharged to his duty on the 10th of October, 1845, since
which period he continued to perform all the duties of a
soldier most efficiently, without experiencing any inconvenience
to his general health or constitution, until the 6th of
October, 1846, when he died of inflammation of the brain, at
Fort George, in Scotland. On dissection, the abdominal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
viscera, including the intestinal canal, appeared perfectly
healthy; but on a minute examination of the portion of
small intestine (found to be the ileum) situated in the inguinal
region of the side operated upon, directly opposite
to the cicatrix of the external wound, it was discovered to be
firmly attached to the abdominal parietes, by an adventitious
membrane, to the extent of two lines, which then diverged,
and formed itself <i>into a canal of a funnel shape for about
five inches and a quarter in length, of a homogeneous
structure, which united itself with the continuous intestinal
tube</i>. By this wonderful provision of nature the
healthy functions were uninterruptedly carried on, and permanently
continued, without any pain or detriment to the
patient’s general health. On appearance, Jan. 23d, 1847.</p>

</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cases of extravasation or of effusion, terminating by the
formation of a sac, pouch, reservoir, or <i>foyer</i> surrounding
it, while the rest of the cavity remains free from inflammation,
are so rare in natives of our northern climates that I
am indisposed to infer that they do take place, except as
very accidental circumstances. The fact that such things
do take place should be borne in mind, and surgery should
not be wanting in giving its aid, under all well-considered
and reasonable circumstances. It is easier to do nothing
than to think and to act.</p>

<p>The general treatment to be pursued in the acute period
of all these cases of inflammation has been sufficiently marked&mdash;antiphlogistic
to the utmost extent consistent with propriety,
by bleeding, leeching, and cupping; the repeated
administration of enemata; the early exhibition of mercury
and opium, and subsequently of gentle aperients.</p>

<p>397. Continental surgeons, and by pre-eminence Baron
Larrey, who is followed on this point by most French surgeons,
inculcate the necessity of enlarging the wounds made
by a musket-ball in the wall of the belly, although the Baron
is particular in confining it to the muscular parts; M.
Baudens, one of the latest writers on the subject, points out
the additional tendency this gives to the formation of hernia,
and furnishes therefore the soundest reason for not doing it
without an especial cause. When a slip of the muscular or
tendinous structures interferes with the quiescence of the
wound; when it is desirable to introduce a finger to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
an examination; when it is necessary to divide a portion to
allow the restoration of protruded parts, no one will doubt
the propriety of the direction. But when neither these nor
any other good or sufficient reason can be given for such an
operation as that of enlarging the wound (<i>débridant la
plaie</i>) simply because it has been usual so to do, at the risk
of making a large hernial protrusion instead of a smaller
one, it is unnecessary. It gives rise to some bleeding, but
that is really nothing; it makes a cut instead of a hole, by
which nothing essential is gained; and as this enlargement
of the wound can always be accomplished when it may become
necessary from a sufficient cause, such interference,
especially on the fore part or the sides of the abdomen, may
be safely omitted.</p>

<p>398. When a musket-ball, passing across the abdomen,
comes out behind through the thick muscles of the back,
with perhaps a slit-like opening in the skin, through which
some urine, and perhaps fecal fluid or matter may also pass,
such wounds should be enlarged both superficially and deeply.
There is here an object to be gained, and the operation is
necessary. There is no objection to its being done when it
is even supposed that these fluids or matters are likely to be
soon or ultimately discharged through it, as it is desirable
that any secretions or effusions which cannot be evacuated
by the natural passages should have every reasonable opportunity
offered of making their escape.</p>

<p>399. When it is obvious, from internal hemorrhage, or
from the discharge of fecal matter, or from the introduction
of the finger, by which it can be felt, that a large hole or
rent has been made in an intestine, the wound should then
be enlarged so as to allow its being brought into sight, when
the edges should, if required, be smoothed, and the continuous
suture applied in the manner directed, Aph. 391.</p>

<p>400. When a musket-ball penetrates the cavity of the
belly, it may pass across in any direction without injuring
the intestines or solid viscera. It usually does injure one
or the other, and it has been known to lodge without doing
much mischief. The symptoms are generally indicated by
the parts injured, although in all the general depression and
anxiety are remarkable; their continuance marks the extent
if not the nature of the mischief.</p>

<p>The following cases of the survivors of hundreds who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
died under similar wounds, during the war beginning with
the battle of Roliça in Portugal, in August, 1808, and ending
with that of Waterloo, in June, 1815, may be read with
a melancholy interest, as showing what sometimes will happen
in a few rare instances, and even then as more dependent
on the wantonness of nature than on the united efforts
of science and of art.</p>

<p>A soldier of the brigade of heavy cavalry, under General
Le Marchant, advancing in line to charge the French infantry
at Salamanca, on which occasion the general was
killed, was struck by a musket-ball, which entered in front,
between the umbilicus and the ilium of the left side and
came out behind on the opposite side above the right
haunch-bone, thus traversing the body. The bowel protruded
in front, but was uninjured, and was easily restored
to its place. He remained at the field hospital with me for
the first three days and was rigorously treated, as well as
afterward in the San Domingo Hospital, where he gradually
recovered, and was ultimately sent to the rear.</p>

<p>Captain Slayter Smith, of the 13th Dragoons, being engaged
at Campo Mayor, on the 25th of March, 1811, was
shot by a pistol-ball, which entered at the left hip, three
inches and a half from the junction of the ilium with the
sacrum, an inch and a half below its crest, and came out
about three inches below the navel, and one inch to its right
side. He felt a terrible shock, but did not faint or fall from
his horse.</p>

<p>“There was a protrusion of bowel from the wound in
front of about three inches; but little blood issued from it.
The hemorrhage from the wound in my back was very
copious. A French officer, with three or four of his men,
were so near me that he called out ‘Rendez vous, mon officier,’
to which I replied, ‘Pas encore, monsieur,’ and rode
away with my bowel in my hand.</p>

<p>“I reached the field hospital shortly afterward, when the
protrusion was returned without enlarging the orifice, and
<i>no</i> stitch was put into the wound then or afterward. It
was dressed merely with lint and adhesive plaster. I begged
earnestly for a glass of Madeira, which, after a little hesitation
on the part of the surgeon, was given to me; but they
afterward thought it necessary to bleed me; but little blood
followed the insertion of the lancet. This was the <i>only</i> time
I was bled. In the morning I found the bed saturated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
blood, which had trickled through to the floor, and had
escaped from the wound behind.</p>

<p>“Before a month had elapsed I and all the wounded were
removed to Elvas on <i>bullock-cars</i>, and a desperate journey
it was.</p>

<p>“On my arrival, inflammation began in the wound in front,
accompanied with great swelling and pain. The swelling
was laid open and a quantity of matter was evacuated, followed
by an angry-looking protrusion, which was carefully
washed with warm water, and poulticed; when the inflammation
had subsided, the wound was dressed as before, with
lint confined by adhesive plaster. When the protrusion was
touched by the hand I experienced a nauseous and disgusting
sensation, to which in comparison the application of the
knife or lancet was a flea-bite.</p>

<p>“I arrived in England in June, and in September went to
Brighton. Soon afterward I felt terrible pains in the <i>right</i>
side of my back, in a line with the wound, through the
ilium, or rather above it, where a kind of tumor formed.
For several days I suffered agony from it; and one night,
completely worn out, I fell into a long and deep sleep, and
awaking late in the morning I found all pain and excrescence
gone, and nothing remaining but a tenderness of the part on
pressure with the finger. I underwent much from violent
spasms in the stomach, which I never had before I was
wounded. I recovered, however, sufficiently to rejoin my
regiment the following spring in the Peninsula, and was
soon afterward again wounded in a skirmish by a spent shot
in the left shoulder, which, however, was of no moment,
though I was compelled to return to England on sick leave,
in October, 1812, as the spasms increased with greater
severity, incapacitating me from doing my duty, and at
times rendering me totally helpless.</p>

<p>“I now gradually recovered my health, and in the spring
of 1815, accompanied the 10th Hussars to Belgium, and
served at Waterloo.</p>

<p>“My health gave way again in 1821, and I certainly was
in a precarious state for three or four years, but I gradually
recovered, and by dint of great care and attention to diet I
am now (1853) in robust health, and can take the strongest
exercise with impunity.”</p>

<p>John Richardson, of the 1st Royal Dragoons, was wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
at the battle of Waterloo by a musket-ball, which entered
two and a half inches above the umbilicus, and passed out
on the left side, close to the lumbar vertebræ. He threw up
a considerable quantity of blood, and the stomach was so
irritable that nothing would remain on it. He complained
of pain, which cut him right across, as he termed it; his
eyes were suffused and face flushed; had headache; pulse
130. Thirty ounces of blood were taken from the arm,
emollient injections thrown up the rectum, and poultices
applied to the wounds.</p>

<p>June 20th.&mdash;Some blood came away with the injections
during the night; great pain in the right side and shoulder;
saline draughts are returned tinged with bile and blood;
pulse 130. Bled to sixteen ounces; injections and poultices
continued.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;A draught was ejected mixed with blood, and a
quantity of bilious fluid; diarrhœa during the night; the
feces were mixed with blood; pulse 120; skin hot. Bleeding
to twelve ounces; blood sizy.</p>

<p>22d.&mdash;Slept a little during the night; had several alvine
evacuations of a bilious fluid mixed with blood. The tension
of the belly is not so great. He still complains of pain.
Tea remains on his stomach. Bleeding to twelve ounces;

<p>Owen M’Caffrey, aged thirty-three, first battalion 95th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
Regiment, was wounded on the 18th of June at the battle
of Waterloo, by a musket-ball, which penetrated the cavity
of the abdomen on the right side, about midway between
the superior anterior spinous process of the ilium and the
linea alba. When admitted into the Minimes General Hospital
three days after, he was in the most deplorable state;
the whole abdomen was tense and exquisitely tender; the
pulse small and wiry; vomiting incessant, with hiccough and
ghastly visage. From this period to the 24th, he was
thrice largely blooded, and the strictest antiphlogistic plan
was laid down and rigidly adhered to. Laxative injections
were administered, the whole of the abdomen was frequently
fomented, and opiates were administered to allay the irritability
of the stomach, and to procure ease and rest. On the
25th the wounded intestine sloughed, and the feces escaped
by the external orifice, <i>the adherence of the two surfaces
of the peritoneum</i> preventing any, even the smallest portion,
getting into the cavity of the abdomen.</p>

<p>26th.&mdash;The high inflammatory action having been reduced,
milk, rice, and sugar, and the farinaceous part of the
potato were allowed.</p>

<p>July 1st.&mdash;No very alarming symptom remains. Half a
fowl ordered for his dinner, and the greatest attention to
personal cleanliness directed to be paid.</p>

<p>7th.&mdash;Strength slowly but gradually returning. The action
of the large intestines is daily kept up by stimulating injections.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;Progress to recovery satisfactory. The injections
are daily repeated, and the discharge by the natural passage
increases. The wound contracts and looks healthy. Is
enabled to sit up, and has recovered his cheerfulness.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;Still improving; ultimately recovered.</p>

<p>The situation of the ball was never ascertained.</p>

<p>A soldier of la Jeune Garde Imperiale was struck by a
ball, which entered to the right and a little below the umbilicus
and passed out on the left or opposite side, about two
inches above the crest of the ilium. It was supposed to
have passed along the canal of the great arch of the colon.
Fecal matter, much tinged with bile, passed by both openings.
The symptoms of inflammation were severe for the
first few days, but gradually yielded to the means employed,
when the bowels began to act regularly by the aid of mild
injections, and the discharge from the wounds gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
lessened; the man was much reduced, but otherwise in good
health, and was sent to France from Brussels, nearly well.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Third Division of Infantry was wounded
during the assault of Ciudad Rodrigo, by a ball which entered
and lodged in the left side of the back, about midway
between the spine and a line drawn to the upper part of the
crest of the ilium, from which opening the contents of the
bowel were discharged. Left among the dead and those
who were supposed to be dying at the field hospital, in the
rear of the trenches, I sent him, with all those of different
corps who were wounded, to my own hospital at Aldea Gallega,
some ten miles off. Here, under a sufficiently vigorous
treatment, of which bleeding, starvation, and quietude were
the prominent features, he gradually recovered. On the fifth
day the ball passed per anum, and on two or three different
occasions afterward portions of his coat, flannel shirt, and
breeches. Fecal matter passed readily through the wound,
while the bowels were gently solicited by common injections
for some time; but the wound gradually closed in, and the
man regained his health, and was sent to the rear with a
slight colored discharge from the wound, not quite free from
odor.</p>

<p>Ensign Wright, 61st Regiment, was wounded by a musket-ball,
on the morning of the 10th of April, at Toulouse. The
ball passed through the abdominal parietes on the right of
the linea alba, nearly half way betwixt the umbilicus and the
pubes, and lodged. Sense of debility, tremor, nausea, small,
feeble pulse, and pain in the lower part of the abdomen
were the immediate symptoms.</p>

<p>Peritonitic and enteritic symptoms of considerable violence
having begun to manifest themselves on the 11th, copious
and repeated evacuations of blood were made by order of
Mr. Guthrie, the Deputy Inspector-General in charge of all
the wounded. Fomentations were applied to the belly;
abstinence in food and drink was strictly enjoined, and the
most rigid antiphlogistic regimen followed. The same practice
was pursued during the 12th, 13th, and 14th, venesection
being performed either two or three times every day, as
the augmented state of the local and general inflammatory
symptoms seemed to require. The bowels during the above
period had continued perfectly free, and the dejections were
tolerably natural in color, but rather dark, and extremely
fetid. He had been frequently troubled with nausea and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
vomiting of bilious matter. Two small doses of castor-oil
had been exhibited.</p>

<p>Toast and water, tea, boiled milk-and-water, with a little
soft bread soaked in it, and mutton and chicken-broth in
small quantities at a time, were all that was allowed him for
food and drink.</p>

<p>April 15th.&mdash;Pulse above 100, weak and small; temperature
natural; the tongue clean. Continued affected with a
degree of nausea and vomiting, after drinks especially; and
some diarrhœa was present.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Was bled last night to twelve ounces, in consequence
of increased pain of abdomen and augmented pyrexia; to-day
quiet and easy, and has had several stools.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Diarrhœa and tenesmus troublesome during the
night; <i>ball voided with the feces at six</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>; it is somewhat
flattened, as if from impinging on a stone; has felt
easy since. Continue antiphlogistic regimen.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;Diarrhœa abated; but the abdomen is tense and
painful on pressure. He is distressed with nausea and vomiting;
pulse 100, and sharp; great thirst; tongue dry.
Bleeding to sixteen ounces; abdomen fomented.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Bleeding was repeated last night from persistence
of the symptoms of peritonitis. Blood drawn very buffy;
has had several loose stools during the night. He is to-day
easy; abdomen now scarcely painful. Fomentations continued.</p>

<p>29th.&mdash;This morning the abdomen was tense and painful
on pressure; he was affected with nausea, and had had
vomiting repeatedly during the night; thirst and pyrexia.
Fomentations were applied from time to time, and yielded
relief. Suspect that he has not observed the prescribed
regimen.</p>

<p>May 1st.&mdash;Pain of abdomen and bilious vomitings during
the night; has had three loose stools. Pulse 110, hard and
small; thirst urgent. Blood let to fainting; fomentations
continued.</p>

<p>2d.&mdash;Last night he was again bled to two ounces, when
fainting supervened. He passed a quiet night; had two
liquid stools; abdomen not painful, nor is he sick at stomach,
nor thirsty. To keep himself warm, particularly the
belly.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;Suspect he has been rather irregular in diet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
Passed a bad night, partly in delirium; has vomited much;
has obviously pain on pressure of the abdomen, but appears
studious to conceal it; pulse 112, small and not soft; temperature
increased; tongue red; thirsty; three liquid stools.
The stomach to be kept warm; ten drops of tincture of
digitalis in half an ounce of mist. acaciæ, to be taken three
times a day; diet of milk and farinaceous food; for drink,
infusion of tea in small quantities. Eight o’clock.&mdash;Pulse
120, soft; feels easier, and has not vomited. Ordered a
foot-bath.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Molested by pains, nausea, and vomiting during
the night; pulse 110, not soft; skin cool, but is thirsty, and
his tongue is of a vermilion color, and arid; confesses that
he has hitherto disguised his feelings, as well as other
circumstances connected with his case, particularly his manner
of living. Digitalis continued; blister to be applied to
the epigastric region, and the foot-bath repeated in the
evening.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;Bad night; pulse 112; skin hot; pain of abdomen
not urgent; no vomiting, but is affected with nausea.
Digitalis continued. Four o’clock.&mdash;Pulse 100; feels nauseated;
no pain of abdomen. Digitalis occasionally.</p>

<p>16th. Eight <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;The tendency to vomit continues. One
grain and a half of chloride of mercury with a grain and a
half of opium, made into a pill, to be taken in the morning;
to be bled. Seven <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Vomits whatever he swallows in
any quantity; skin hot; thirst great; tongue red; two motions;
says abdomen is not painful; pulse 112. A blister
to be again applied to the epigastrium; foot-bath in the
evening; repeat the mucilaginous mixture for cough.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Rested ill; blister has not risen; cough has been
severe and continues so; two motions; pulse 120, and not
soft; cough augmented by deep inspiration, and pain produced.
Take blood from the arm to eight ounces; foot-bath
in the evening; continue pill.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Bad night; cough gone; respiration easy; pulse
100; skin cool and moist; no thirst; one motion of a
natural kind. Repeat mucilage and the calomel and opium
pill.</p>

<p>24th.&mdash;Has this morning experienced a severe attack of
dyspnœa, attended by cough and pain of chest, both increased
by full inspiration. Pulse 120; face flushed; says
he caught cold from exposure to the night air. Bled im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>mediately,
and as much blood taken as his strength would
permit; foot-bath repeated in the evening.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Six ounces of blood drawn; surface buffy; bad
night; cough, pain, and pyrexia abated this morning; in
the evening severe dyspnœa; cough and pain of chest have
recurred; pulse 120. Six ounces of blood to be drawn,
should strength permit; mucilaginous mixture to be continued;
another blister to be applied to the chest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>Sergeant Matthews, of the 28th Regiment, was wounded
at Waterloo by a musket-ball, about an inch below the umbilicus,
a little to the right side, which lodged. He walked
to a village in the rear, where he remained for three days,
having been bled each day to fainting, before he was removed
to Brussels, where my attention was particularly attracted to
him, in consequence of his having passed the ball (a small
rifle one) per anum, three days after his arrival, or the sixth
from the receipt of the wound. The wound was healed by
the end of August; and he felt so well that he marched to
Paris with other convalescents, to joint his regiment. After
some weeks he got drunk, and suffered from an attack of
pain in the bowels, in the situation of the wound, requiring
active treatment. On attempting one day to have a motion,
he found, after many efforts, that something blocked up the
anus, and on taking hold of and drawing it out, he found it
was a portion of the waistband of his breeches, including a
part of the button-hole&mdash;a fact verified by Staff-Surgeon
Dease, who wrote to me an account of this peculiar case.
After this the man recovered without further difficulty, although,
as in all such cases, there was a herniary projection.
He was afterward subject to costiveness, to pain in the part
after a copious meal, probably from the stretching of the
adhesions formed between the intestine and the abdominal
peritoneum, which inclined him to bend his body forward to
obtain relief.</p>

<p>In all such cases, the extraneous substance having lodged,
and mainly injured in all probability the vitality of the part
which assists in the lodgment, the ball becomes covered with
a layer of coagulable lymph or fiber, capable of retaining
it in its new situation, whence it is gradually removed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
ulceration, or by the sloughing of the injured parts into the
cavity of the bowel; much in the same manner as an abscess
in the liver is evacuated into the duodenum or neighboring
intestine, to which it may become attached. It is always
fortunate when the canal from the external wound is cut off
by the deposition of lymph, as it expedites the cure, and
renders the injury less formidable; but if this should not
take place, the contents of the bowel are discharged through
it for a greater or shorter length of time, until the canal
between the parts gradually closes, and cicatrization takes
place, in default of which an artificial anus may remain in
addition to the natural one, the functions of the bowels
generally being performed with more or less difficulty.</p>

<p>The two following very interesting cases of abdominal
injury having been received while these pages were passing
through the press, are here inserted:&mdash;</p>

<p>A man in the 19th Regiment was wounded through the
abdomen, and survived nineteen hours, the ball entering
near to the umbilicus, and passing out close to the sacrum.
On the post-mortem examination, the small intestines were
found to have been wounded no less than sixteen times by
the ball in its passage. When wounded, he was stooping in
the act of defecation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the evening after the battle of Alma, as my regiment
was halting on the brow of a hill, previous to bivouacking, a
wounded Russian officer, apparently in great pain, was perceived
on the other side of the ravine. Passing over to
where he lay, I found that he had been wounded by a musket-ball,
that had entered the lumbar region directly over the
spine. As he was enabled in his agony to crawl on his
hands and knees, it was evident there was no paralysis, and
on passing a probe I found the ball had avoided the spine,
but as I could not pass in the instrument more than an inch,
I was left in uncertainty as to its further course.</p>

<p>He was removed to my hospital tent, when I tried, but
with little success, to remove the excessive pain from which
he was suffering. In about two hours after he took my
finger and placed it on a hard substance imbedded in the
walls of the abdomen, and on cutting down on this I perceived
a musket-ball. Previous to extracting it, however, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
observed a white, glistening substance oozing from the
wound, which, on carefully removing with the probe, proved
to be a portion of tape-worm, about a yard and a half in
length. I then extracted the ball, and again another portion
of the worm presented, which measured about two yards
and a half in length. It was now complete, though cut in
two evidently by the ball, and the two portions, one containing
the head and the other the tail, were soon writhing on
the table.</p>

<p>The patient experienced immediate relief; the pain had
ceased; he slept well, and on the following morning he was
free from thirst, with a tolerably quiet pulse. Unfortunately
the order arrived for all prisoners and wounded to be sent
to the rear, and I lost sight of the case.</p>

<p>What was the cause of this agony of pain? Evidently the
writhing of the worm, or why should it so suddenly cease
on the worm’s liberation? The abdomen must have been
entered by the ball, or how could the worm’s exit have been
effected? Nevertheless, but for its presence, the patient
was so free from constitutional symptoms on the following
morning that a surmise might really have arisen that the
ball had passed round the abdomen without injury to the
peritoneum.</p>

<p class="h2sub">ABNORMAL OR ARTIFICIAL ANUS, ETC.</p>

<p>401. In some cases of wounds of the intestine the continuity
of the bowel is not sufficiently re-established; the
external wound remains open, and becomes indurated and
fistulous, giving passage to the fecal matters, and rendering
the sufferers very miserable. These cases are of rare occurrence
among the hardy natives of Great Britain and Ireland,
and comparatively little has been done or even recommended
in this country for the relief of this misfortune.</p>

<p>When an intestine has lost a more or less considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
part of its substance at a particular spot, and an artificial
anus is about to be formed, it adheres to the peritoneum
around the inside of the external wound, although the adhesion
is of little extent or width, and forms but a narrow
barrier for the protection of the cavity of the abdomen.
The upper end of the bowel is more open than the lower,
the caliber of which is contracted in size, and is sometimes
even difficult to find; while its opening is partially closed
by a sort of septum extending across, or from where the two
portions of a divided gut have come irregularly in contact
with each other by their sides, without uniting in the first
instance in their length; or from the falling in especially of
the posterior part of the lower end, to which the upper has
become united. The projection thus formed in the tube is
called by the French <i>eperon</i> or <i>promontoire</i>, valve or spur,
ridge or septum; it directs the fecal matter through the external
wound, while it obstructs its passage into the lower
part of the bowel. There is generally great difficulty in
ascertaining the fact of the existence and exact situation of
this valve during life; in distinguishing the upper from the
lower end of the intestine, as well as the nature and extent
of the adhesions by which the injured intestine is retained in
its situation. If the absence of such a valve can be satisfactorily
made out&mdash;and it is sometimes wanting&mdash;the external
opening may be successfully closed by compression,
or by operation. If the valve should exist, its removal by
a preliminary operation is necessary; it has been attempted
in France with various but somewhat doubtful success.</p>

<p>402. When a portion of small intestine has been lost by
mortification or otherwise, and the patient has recovered
with an unnaturally situated or artificial anus, the intestine,
although at first in contact with the wall of the abdomen, is
gradually, in many cases though not in all, retracted into the
cavity&mdash;it has been supposed by the dragging of the mesentery
upon it at the point of union of the divided extremities
outside where the <i>eperon</i> or valve is formed; and it is said
that this dragging has even led to the gradual disappearance
of the valve, admitting thereby of the contents passing
more readily from the upper part of the intestine into the
lower, and consequently laying the foundation for a cure.
This dragging of the intestine, or its movements under the
different motions of the body, in some cases cause an elongation
of the membrane formed under the adhesive process,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
by which the intestine is attached to the inside of the wall
of the abdomen in the same manner as adhesions are elongated
between the pleuræ, and a sac or pouch is thus formed
between the cut ends of the intestine and the fistulous external
opening which Scarpa was the first fully to demonstrate
and explain, and which he called an <i>entonnoir</i>, <i>infundibulum</i>,
or funnel. If, then, in an old case, a small portion of
the wall of the abdomen be removed in the form of a V, the
internal opening at the apex of the V, if small, would be
made into a sort of funnel, while the outer incision would
remove all the hardened fistulous parts&mdash;an operation which
is sometimes required to be done when the external opening
is not free, and fecal matters have insinuated themselves
between the aponeurotic parts, giving rise to abscesses and
other small fistulous openings in different directions. It is
necessary to bear the formation of this pouch in mind as well
as that of the valve, in order to understand the operations
proposed for the relief or cure of this complaint.</p>

<p>If simple compression fail in the first instance to prevent
the passage of the feces, which never can be thoroughly
controlled from the want of a sphincter and the uncertainty
of pressure, the method of Desault may be adopted. This
consists in gradually dilating the external wound so as to
enable the operator to discover the open ends of the bowel,
when a tent is to be introduced into the lower end, and
afterward into the upper, being fastened by a thread passed
around its middle. A pyramidal-shaped pad is then to be
placed over the opening, and compression made by bandage
upon it so as to press the whole inward. The size of the
tent is to be gradually enlarged until the contents of the gut
begin to pass downward with ease, when a well adjusted
pressure is to be made on the fistulous opening only, to prevent
all oozing from it until the internal parts have had time
to close.</p>

<p>403. Dupuytren invented a pair of forceps, consisting of
a male and female branch, to be applied separately, one on
each side of the valve or <i>eperon</i>, to the extent of an inch or
an inch and a half at most, when they were to be closed by
a screw until they had compressed the part between them
sufficiently to destroy its life. The separation of the valve
included within the forceps would take place by the usual
processes of ulceration in its immediate proximity, and by
adhesion of the parts external to the bowels to those sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>rounding
them. The inflammation, however, did not always
stop at the adhesive stage, and death has been the result as
well as a successful cure.</p>

<p>404. Mr. Trant has invented an instrument he calls a
propeller, for pressing back the eperon, an account of which
is given in the <i>Dublin Medical Press</i>, May 14th, 1845.
He used this in one case with complete success. The instrument
by its formation admits of being passed through
the artificial anus, and of being placed on the <i>eperon</i> at the
bottom of the wound, where it can be retained for a considerable
time without producing the slightest inconvenience.
It does not, while in the intestines, offer any obstruction to
the passage of the fecal matters flowing along the cavity of
the tube. It acts as a forceps in retaining the anterior wall
of the intestine in close contact with the posterior surface of
the abdominal parietes, while the propeller is pressing back
the <i>eperon</i> toward the spine; consequently the danger of
separating the delicate adhesions in this situation is prevented,
otherwise a fatal extravasation into the cavity of the
abdomen might ensue. The instrument was made by Mr.
Reed, of Dublin, and merits further trial, being apparently
less dangerous than the other methods recommended in similar
cases. Whatever may be the method employed for the
cure of an artificial anus by operation, it cannot be doubted
that the patient must be exposed to all the dangers which
may result from inflammation, for which he must be prepared
beforehand, and the symptoms of which must be met and
subdued as they arise; or, if this cannot be accomplished,
the mechanical means, if any be used that can be taken
away, must be removed, and quiet, if possible, restored by
their abstraction and by the treatment adopted. In successful
cases, a small aperture will frequently remain, constituting
a fecal fistula instead of an artificial anus. This will
sometimes become irritable, inflame, ulcerate, or burst, discharging
the solid contents of the bowel, although, on the
subsidence of the irritation, the part under pressure usually
returns to its former state.</p>

<p>405. <i>Wounds and injuries of the liver</i>, whether incised
or penetrating, occurring from blows or from musket-balls,
are very serious, although not <i>necessarily</i> fatal. Some few
persons recover altogether, some few with more or less of
permanent disability. The remainder die during the first or
inflammatory stage, or in the secondary one, which follows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
from the twelfth or fourteenth day after the primary symptoms
have in some measure subsided.</p>

<p>The symptoms which ensue after a wound of the liver are
those common to inflammation of the cavity of the abdomen,
with the addition of those peculiar to the organ&mdash;pulse
often smaller and less perceptible than in peritonitis; discoloration
of the skin, eyes, and urine, amounting even to
jaundice, although this is not an immediate symptom, neither
is it always present. The pain is not confined to the part,
but extends to the umbilicus, while the pain symptomatic of
inflammation of the liver&mdash;viz., pain in the top of the right
shoulder&mdash;is felt early, and is often accompanied by cramps
of the muscles of the arms and numbness of the fingers. The
usual symptoms of anxiety and depression are present, and
the stomach shows by its irritability that it has partaken of
the shock given to the system. The bowels are usually
confined, but I have known blood passed from them when it
was not supposed that the stomach or intestines had been
wounded; the discharge from the wound is either of blood
or bile, or both, mixed with a serous effusion which afterward
becomes purulent. Wounds of the gall-bladder are, as far
as is known, fatal&mdash;the effusion of bile which immediately
takes place giving rise to inflammation which, with other
causes, destroys the sufferer at the end of a few days. If
the gall-bladder be adherent to the peritoneum from any
previous inflammation, a wound in it need not prove mortal,
as the effusion would be avoided, and there is no reason to
believe that an injury to this part would be otherwise more
vital than that of any other of the viscera of the abdomen.</p>

<p>The late Lieut.-General Sir S. Barns, when Lieut.-Colonel
of the Royals, was wounded at the battle of Salamanca by
a musket-ball, which injured the cartilages of the false ribs,
a portion of the rib being removed and passed out through
the liver. A bilious discharge continued several weeks from
the wound, and his life was saved with great difficulty. He
returned to his duties, although suffering from a dragging
pain and weight in the side, which any exertion increased.
In the autumn of 1819 he was attacked by acute inflammation;
the pain in the right side, extending over the stomach
and umbilicus, was constant and acute, and increased on
pressure; the pulse small, indeed scarcely perceptible; the
extremities cold; the countenance depressed and anxious;
bowels confined; stomach rather irritable. A number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
leeches were applied, and other remedies administered. The
constant pain, which was increased by pressure, could only
be relieved by loss of blood, although every other symptom
seemed to forbid depletion. Twenty ounces of blood were
taken from the arm, which caused a diminution of the pain,
and gave relief for an hour; the pain then returned, and
twelve ounces more blood were taken away, with the most
beneficial effect; a blister was applied over the part, and a
dose of calomel and opium was repeated. Shortly afterward
he became tranquil; the extremities lost their coldness; and,
although the pain continued in a slight degree for several
hours, and much soreness remained for many days, he quickly
recovered. Two months afterward he had another and
equally severe attack, in consequence of walking about two
miles rather hastily; from that he was relieved in a similar
manner. Whenever he bent his body, a portion of the rib
appeared to press in upon the liver, and often gave him
acute, darting pain; and one day, on pulling on his boot in
haste with some bodily exertion, a third attack ensued. In
order to prevent the bending of the body forward, and to
confine the motion of the liver, which seemed liable to injury
from the irregular points of bone which could be readily distinguished
above it, stays, made with iron plates instead of
whalebone, were adapted to his body, and from these he
derived great comfort.</p>

<p>Corporal Macdonald, first battalion, 79th Regiment, was
wounded on the 16th of June at Quatre Bras, by a musket-ball,
which entered the abdomen, splintered the eighth rib
on the right side, passed through the liver, and was supposed
to have lodged on the opposite side, as he says he
felt the ball strike the left side, on which he was not able to
lie for a long time. Lost but little blood at the time; was
dressed superficially, and arrived in Brussels on the 19th,
laboring under considerable fever. Bleeding to thirty-six
ounces. For seven successive days the bleeding was repeated,
to from twelve to sixteen ounces each day, when a
large, bilious, and purulent discharge took place from the
wound, on which the inflammatory symptoms appeared to
subside, until the 30th of June, when bleeding took place
from the wound during the night to the extent of twenty
ounces, and then ceased spontaneously. On the 15th of July
the hemorrhage recurred with so much fever as to warrant
twenty ounces of blood being taken from the arm, and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
was repeated the next day. The bilious discharge ceased in
the middle of August, and on the 2d of September he was
discharged convalescent.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Edward Hooper, first battalion, 38th Regiment,
was wounded by a musket-ball on the 9th of December,
1812. It passed through the anterior edge of the liver,
and, glancing round the ribs, was cut out about two inches
from the spine.</p>

<p>On his being wounded, he could scarcely believe his
shoulder was not the part affected. His pulse was intermitting;
the breathing hurried and laborious, and in a short
time the tunicæ conjunctivæ became yellow. He was <i>very
largely</i> bled, and warm fomentations were applied to the
abdomen, from which, and the bleeding, he received some
temporary relief; but, in consequence of his removal that
night to the rear, the symptoms were much aggravated on
the morning of the 10th. He complained of acute pain
over the whole abdomen, increased on pressure; vomiting;
quick, hard, and wiry pulse, (no pain referred to the wound.)
The bleeding was repeated ad deliquium, warm fomentations
and an enema also repeated, and a saline mixture, with a
<i>very few</i> drops of tincture of opium, to allay the irritability
of the stomach. On the following evening the vomiting had
ceased; his pulse was less frequent and hard; pain less. On
the 11th, after passing a very restless night, the pulse again
rose; the abdomen became tense but not very painful, and
he made ineffectual efforts to stool. He was again bled, a
large blister was applied over the abdomen, and an ounce of
castor-oil was given immediately. The blister acted well,
and the purgative gave him three copious stools of dark and
fetid feces. On the 12th he complained of twitching pains,
referred to the right shoulder, and was ordered one grain of
calomel, with two of antimonial powder, three times a day.</p>

<p>Jan. 13th.&mdash;Was free from pain; pulse fuller and less
frequent; urine clear; tension of abdomen subsided. The
calomel and antimony were continued, and some light nourishment
was allowed. From this day a gradual amendment
took place. The calomel was continued until his mouth became
slightly affected; and, as his bowels were in general
torpid, from the deficient secretion of bile, a mild purgative
was given every two or three days, as occasion required, and
an ounce of the infusion of calumba, with quassia, three or
four times daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
A soldier of the 48th Regiment was struck by a musket-ball
at Albuhera, on the upper part of the right hypochondrium,
over the liver; it came out behind, at a point immediately
corresponding to that in front. Blood and bile were
discharged from the wounds in considerable quantity, and his
case was considered to be hopeless. Brought to me at Valverde,
the next day, he was bled largely several times; the
wounds were dressed simply, and he was kept perfectly quiet,
and his bowels gently open. The skin became of a yellow color,
his strength failed under the treatment, and he became thin,
and looked ill. At the end of three weeks he was sent to
Elvas, where he gradually improved, and was forwarded
thence to Lisbon and to England, with his wounds healed.</p>

<p>An officer was wounded in one of the battles in the Pyrenees,
by a musket-ball, which penetrated the outer part of
the right hypochondrium, at the edge of the false ribs, and
lodged. Blood and bile flowed in considerable quantity; the
skin became yellow, the pain and swelling of the abdomen
were considerable, and he was given over as lost. Under
a vigorous and careful treatment he gradually recovered, so
as to be sent to England, with a fistulous opening at the orifice
of entrance. I examined the wound in 1817, three years
afterward, and found that a large blunt probe passed inward
toward the stomach and liver for the distance of five inches,
where it ended apparently in a sort of sac. Purulent and
bilious matters were constantly discharged from the wound;
his countenance was sallow; his digestion bad; he suffered
from constant uneasiness, if not pain, and was altogether out
of health. I saw him once annually for several years, and
found that I could sometimes strike the ball with the probe;
that he frequently, after an attack of pain and derangement,
passed matter by stool, after which the pain and uneasiness
about the wound ceased. I had hopes the ball would some
day pass through the opening thus made, and had thoughts
of enlarging the external wound, and of endeavoring to extract
the ball with a long pair of forceps. He ceased at last
to pay his annual visit, and I suspect he died in one of the
attacks I have alluded to. This ball must have passed very
close to, if it did not penetrate, the gall-bladder.</p>

<p>I have never had an opportunity of extracting a ball
from the liver during life, although I have seen persons live
many weeks into whose livers balls had penetrated; and I
have been acquainted with three persons who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
wounded through the liver, to whom little subsequent inconvenience
was occasioned.</p>

<p>406. Portions of the liver have been removed in some instances;
in one case, related by Blanchard, a small piece of
liver was removed with the forceps. The patient dying of
fever three years afterward, a small piece of the liver near
the external wound was found wanting. Dieffenbach gives
a case in which a small protruded portion was cut off with
scissors, without any bad consequence. Dr. Macpherson, in
the ‘<i>London Medical Gazette</i>’ for January, 1846, has related
the case of a Hindoo, a large piece of whose liver protruded
through a wound an inch in length, made by a spear
in the right hypochondriac region. A ligature was applied
tightly around its base, and the piece cut off, rather than
make such an enlargement of the wound as might allow the
restoration of the protruded liver. The arteries bled from
the cut surface, and required to be tied, and a double ligature
was put through the stump of liver and tied on each
side. The part was not pushed back into the abdomen, but
allowed to remain in the wound. The symptoms were mild,
the ligatures came away on the ninth day, and the man returned
to his home in three weeks.</p>

<p>These cases may be considered exceptions to the general
rule, which directs the return of all protruded parts. The
retention of the part from which the piece was cut off within
the divided parts of the wound was agreeable to the principles
I have inculcated with respect to wounds of all the
cavities.</p>

<p>407. <i>Wounds of the stomach</i> are usually fatal, although
some persons escape when these injuries are confined to its
anterior and upper surface, and do not penetrate both sides,
in which case effusion into the cavity of the abdomen, and consequent
inflammation, can scarcely fail to ensue. It is fortunate
for the patient, when they occur, that the stomach should
be empty. If it should not be so, the contents may possibly
be ejected shortly after the receipt of the wound, but it is
not advisable to excite vomiting by remedies, or by means
adapted for that purpose. In a perfectly quiescent state, the
general compression of the contents of the abdomen by its
walls may prevent effusion under ordinary circumstances, and
this state should be maintained as rigidly as possible. The
apparent course of the wound indicates the probable mis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>chief,
which is especially confirmed by vomiting of blood,
great anxiety, depression of countenance, a cold, clammy
skin, pain in the part, hiccough, and by the discharge of the
contents of the stomach, if the wound be sufficiently open to
allow it; pulse low and sometimes intermittent. If effusion
of the contents of the stomach should not occur, the external
wound, if an incised one, should be closed by suture, and
the patient kept in the utmost state of quietude, in a somewhat
elevated position, the abdominal muscles being relaxed.
Neither food nor drink should enter the stomach, although
thirst should be allayed by wetting the tongue and mouth.
The bowels should be relieved by enemata, and the belly
fomented. Bleeding and leeching, as frequently repeated as
the symptoms appear to require, must be carried to the
greatest extent that can be permitted with safety.</p>

<p>When the external wound is so large as to enable the
wounded stomach to be seen, the cut edges of the wound in
it should be brought together by the continuous suture, as in
the intestines; and the external wound should be closed in
a similar manner, the end of the ligature on the wound of
the stomach being cut off close to the viscus, that organ
being left perfectly free, with the hope that the thread will
be carried into its cavity, while the outside adheres to the
peritoneum opposed to it.</p>

<p>When the stomach pours its contents through an external
opening, too small to allow its being examined, it is desirable
that the wound should be enlarged, if a doubt be entertained
of the passage being free. It is a sufficient reason
for such an operation to allow the opening in the stomach
to be seen. It is very probable that effusion will take place
into the cavity of the abdomen if it be not done, and the
death of the patient will follow. It is very probable he will
die if it be done, and therefore in such cases little has hitherto
been attempted. I am of opinion, however, that in the
case I have last alluded to, a blunt hook may be sometimes
introduced through the wound into the stomach, so as to
keep it stationary while the external opening is carefully
enlarged, and that it ought to be done in such cases, and the
wound in the stomach closed in the manner recommended.
I have never had a case under my care in which I could
have done this; but I have seen some die in whom it might
have been done; and it deserves to be considered when surgeons
shall be in sufficient numbers on the field of battle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
attend to such recommendations, and to the after-treatment
these cases require.</p>

<p>When the stomach is injured by a musket-ball, and its
contents are discharged externally, the edges of the wound,
not being in a condition to unite, must remain open for several
days. The person should be placed in the mean time in
the most easy and comfortable position which may enable
the contents of the stomach to be readily passed out externally,
if they show any disposition to be thus evacuated.
The external wound should be dilated as far as the peritoneum,
if it should be required, so as to admit of the
passage being direct, and symptoms must be awaited and
treated as they arise. If the patient should survive the first
or inflammatory stage, he should be supported by clysters
composed of strong beef-tea or veal broth, given five or six
times during the twenty-four hours. When it may be expected
that the wound in the stomach has closed, or that
the injured portion has adhered to the neighboring parts,
warm jellies and light broths may be frequently given in
small quantities, but solid food should be forbidden until
complete recovery has taken place. I have seen inattention
to this precaution in more than one instance prove fatal.</p>

<p>408. Fistulous openings have been known to follow wounds
of the stomach, and to continue for years. The case related
by Dr. Beaumont of the American army, of St. Martin, who,
in 1822, received an extensive wound in the stomach, which
became fistulous, admitting of a variety of most interesting
inquiries being made into the process of digestion, is remarkable.</p>

<p>Hevin has related some of the most interesting cases of
those who had swallowed knives, etc., by design or by accident,
and whose stomachs were opened for their removal.
The most ridiculous story of the whole is an instructive one,
however. Some young students, desirous of punishing a
young woman who had offended them, cut short the hair of
the tail of a large pig, and when frozen hard, forcibly pushed
it up her anus, leaving a couple of inches only hanging out
of the small end or tip. The hairs having been cut short
caught in the gut when attempts were made to draw out the
tail, and gave her inexpressible pain. The most serious
symptoms followed during six days, and every attempt having
failed, Marchetti was applied to. He prepared a hollow
tube two feet long, large enough to receive the thickest part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
of the pig’s tail, to the end of which he fastened a strong
waxed cord, which he drew through the tube. This he
carefully introduced into the anus, pushing it over the pig’s
tail, until he drew the whole of it into the tube, which he
then brought away, including the tail, to the great relief of
the sufferer.</p>

<p>409. The necessity for an operation so grave as that of
opening the stomach must be shown by the presumed impossibility
of the foreign substances being dissolved, or of their
passing out of it by any other means, while the continued
distress they occasion more than equals the risk which is
likely to be incurred. The offending substance ought to be
felt through the wall of the abdomen, and the incision for
its removal should be made between the recti muscles in the
linea alba, unless the foreign body have actually pierced the
stomach, and can be felt to the outside of the rectus muscle,
at which part the incision ought to be made obliquely in the
direction of the fibers of the external oblique muscle, all
bleeding vessels being secured before the peritoneum is
opened. This having been accomplished, the protruding
body should be extracted by such an enlargement of the
opening in the stomach as may be actually necessary. When
the substance does not protrude, although it can be felt
through the wall of the stomach, it will be advisable, if possible,
to draw it toward the upper or smaller curvature of
the stomach rather than to the lower, avoiding the coronary
vessels, and taking a medium distance for the opening from
the cardiac orifice, and thereby such advantage as may be
derived from gravitation. The wound in the stomach should
be united by the continuous suture, and the external wound
should be closed in a similar manner. The patient ought to
be kept in bed in an easy erect position.</p>

<p>410. <i>Injuries of the spleen</i> have been usually fatal, from
hemorrhage filling the general cavity of the abdomen, especially
when they have arisen from rupture of that organ,
which I have several times seen occur in consequence of
falls, or from blows from cannon-shot, which have not
opened into the cavity or exposed the viscus. Wounds
from musket-balls have for the most part destroyed the sufferers,
either from hemorrhage or from inflammation. I
have not seen nor heard, during the Peninsular war, of a
wound in the abdomen through which the spleen protruded,
the patient recovering. Instances have occurred in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
this part has been removed in man after its exposure by
injury. A case is said to have taken place after the battle
of Dettingen, in which the spleen, covered with dirt, was
cut off, and the patient recovered. In another case the
spleen, found without the wound at the end of twenty-four
hours, was cold, black, and mortified. The surgeon placed
a ligature above this part, and cut off three inches and a
half of the spleen; a large artery was tied, and the remaining
portion of the viscus was returned into the cavity of
the belly, the ligature hanging to it, and the patient got
well.</p>

<p>Wounds from stabs with a bayonet, or a sabre, or long-pointed
sword are frequently fatal, either from hemorrhage
or from inflammation; but I have seen accidentally, after
death, cicatrixes in the spleen corresponding to external
marks, indicative of a former wound. The treatment, in all
such cases, should be to encourage the discharge of blood
from the part, in the first instance; then to close the external
wound if an incised one, to place the patient on the
injured side, and to subdue all unnecessary inflammation by
bleeding, leeching, absolute rest, and starvation. The application
of warm fomentations where an oozing of blood
may be expected to take place cannot be recommended, and
cold should be substituted if agreeable to the feelings of the
patient. When the blow or wound does not cause the death
of the individual by hemorrhage or acute inflammation, a
chronic state of disease may supervene, which, if not duly
combated, will ultimately destroy him. The early administration
of calomel and opium, and the repeated application
of blisters, will, in these cases, as well as in those of wounds
of the liver, be of the greatest service. Effusion or suppuration
may take place as well as in those cases which have
been noticed, when other viscera have been injured; although
instances of such terminations are not recorded, it does not
follow that they have not taken place.</p>

<p>411. <i>Wounds affecting the kidney</i> have been less fatal
than those of the spleen, although they are scarcely less dangerous,
from the complications by which they are attended;
the successful cases on record are not numerous, and the
practice to be pursued can only be general. The results,
when not fatal, have been for the most part unknown, from
the patients either lingering on or recovering after they
have been discharged from the service. I saw two cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
this nature after the battle of Waterloo. In one, the ball
had passed through the abdomen, entering a little below and
to the left of the umbilicus, and coming out behind nearly
opposite and close to the spine. No fecal matter was discharged
from the front wound, but some came through the
posterior one, accompanied by a small quantity of urine, indicating
a lesion of the kidney or of the ureter at its upper
part. The symptoms, at first severe, had subsided under
proper treatment, and there was every probability that the
sufferer would eventually recover, although I was unable to
trace the case after the man left Brussels. In the other,
pain was principally felt in the testis and the spermatic cord
of the side injured.</p>

<p>An officer was wounded on the right side, on the 9th December,
1813, the ball being cut out behind; his case was
considered hopeless. An hour afterward, on being moved
to the fire, he desired to make water, and then passed what
appeared to him to be a quantity of blood. Carried to the
rear on a wagon for three leagues, he suffered beyond description,
passed bloody water again, and on his arrival in
quarters was bled and had an enema administered. He then
became delirious, was bled several times, had blisters applied
to the abdomen, suffered from pain at the top of the right
shoulder, and took no other nourishment but tea for fourteen
days. He gradually recovered, and at the end of seven
weeks was sent to England. After remaining some time
in London, he joined the depot of his regiment. In consequence
of this exertion, he suffered an attack of fever
and peritoneal inflammation; and a tumor formed in the
site of the posterior wound, which was opened, and discharged
several ounces of matter of a urinous odor. Another
abscess formed, and was opened. During this time he
suffered great pain and became greatly emaciated; the urine
diminished in quantity with the frequent calls to pass it. He
lingered in this state until the end of July. The flow of
matter from the wound was great, and had a urinous smell.
The desire to make water was incessant; but it passed only
by drops, and brought him to a state of frenzy; the discharge
from the wounds, which had been lessening for two
days before, suddenly stopped; the pain and pressure of
urine became intolerable; he remained at last in a state of
the greatest torture for about three minutes, when, during
an effort, a burst of urine took place, colored with blood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
forcing out with it a hard lump, shaped like a short, thick
shrimp, three-quarters of an inch long, which proved, when
examined next day, to be the cloth which had been driven
in by the ball. It must have passed from the pelvis of the
kidney or the ureter into the bladder. It was hard, was covered
by a black crust, and was thought to be a stone when
passed. It could not, however, have been long in the bladder,
or it would have been covered by the triple phosphates,
and have formed the nucleus of a calculus requiring to be
removed by operation.</p>

<p>Le Capitaine Negre, of the French Infantry of the Line,
was struck on the left side above the hip, at the battle of
Albuhera, by a musket-ball, which went through the upper
part of the sigmoid flexure of the colon, and came out behind,
injuring apparently the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebræ.
As urine came through this opening, the ureter or
lower part of the kidney must have been wounded; and, as
he had lost the use of one leg and much of that of the other,
the spinal marrow must also have been injured. He was left
on the field of battle, supposed to be about to die, and was
brought to me to the village of Valverde, three days afterward,
in a most distressing state. The inflammatory symptoms
had been and were severe; the pain he suffered on any
attempt to move him was excessive; the discharge of feces
from the anterior wound, and of urine from the posterior
one and by the usual ways, rendered him miserable, and he
at last implored me to allow the box of opium pills, of which
one was given at night to each man who stood most in need
of them, to be left within his reach, if I would not kindly
do the act of a friend and give them to him myself. He
died at the end of ten days, after great suffering, constantly
regretting that our feelings as Christians caused their
prolongation.</p>

<p>412. <i>Wounds of the spermatic cord</i> are of infrequent
occurrence, and rarely lead to fatal, although often to
inconvenient consequences.</p>

<p>I have removed the bruised and shattered remains of a
testis and epididymis to expedite the cure, and I have been
obliged to do so at a later period in consequence of the
wounded portion becoming enlarged and diseased. These
occurrences are rare; the wound in the testis usually heals
kindly; but the portion which remains, however, is probably
of little use, although the patient does not like to lose it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
A gentleman in perfect health was struck accidentally in the
right testis by two shot, while out shooting partridges. The
shot lodged, and gave rise to uneasiness, and after a time to
an enlargement, which could not be distinguished from medullary
sarcoma. I removed the testis, and the wound healed
kindly. The lumbar glands had, however, taken on the disease,
and he died of their great enlargement and the general
mischief which ensued within the year. The preparation is
in the museum of the College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>I have not had occasion to tie an artery, even when the
penis has been as good as amputated. If bleeding should
take place in the progress of the cure, a large catheter
should be introduced into the urethra, as a point on which
pressure may be made laterally; for I am not aware of any
other use it can be, unless the urethra be also torn, when a
moderate-sized catheter should be kept in it permanently, if
it can be borne, to aid in the healing of the surrounding
parts with as little contraction as possible of the canal.
When the corpus spongiosum has been carried away or
sloughs with the urethra, there is usually some injury done
at the same time to the corpora cavernosa, and the part
becomes contracted and curved when distended. I have not
seen any of these cases since the introduction into practice
of the methods which have been recommended by Dieffenbach
and others for the formation of a new urethra by borrowing
from the neighboring parts; but several might
certainly have been benefited by such treatment.</p>

<p>A married soldier, of the 29th Regiment, was wounded
on the heights of Roliça, in August, 1808, by a small musket-ball,
which went through both corpora cavernosa from
side to side. The man suffered very little inconvenience,
and the wounds healed very well. He seemed to consider
the injury as of no importance to himself, but had some idea
there might be a difference of opinion in another party.
There is usually a deficiency of substance at the part after
such wounds, and sometimes on inconvenient curve or twist,
such as often takes place when the corpora cavernosa and
the corpus spongiosum are injured or ruptured from other
causes.</p>

<p class="h2sub">WOUNDS OF THE PELVIS, ETC.</p>

<p>413. <i>Wounds of the pelvis</i> from musket-balls injuring
its contents are of common occurrence, and, although frequently
fatal, often permit a considerable length of treatment
before they destroy the sufferers or admit of their recovery.
In many instances fistulous openings remain for years. The
orifices of entrance and of exit of the ball lead to little information.
It is only from the absence of paralysis or of
hemorrhage, or of those signs which indicate the lesion of
any of the organs contained within the pelvis, that the surgeon
can form an estimate of the evil which has been committed;
even when parts of the greatest importance are
injured, such as the bladder or the rectum, the general
symptoms are occasionally of little moment.</p>

<p>When paralysis occurs, which it rarely does unless the
spinal marrow be injured, the functions of the bladder and
of the rectum are implicated, and there is but little pain.
When the nerves only are injured, the paralysis is not complete;
it usually affects one side more than the other, is a
numbness rather than a paralysis, and is accompanied by
severe pain, sometimes at the seat of injury, but more usually
extending to the thigh and to the extremities of the
nerves in the foot. I was consulted in a case of wound from
a pistol-shot, in the last dorsal or upper lumbar vertebra, of
several years’ standing, in which the paralysis of both limbs
was complete. The patient had a great desire to have the
cicatrix opened, and the ball followed and extracted, and
would willingly have submitted to such an operation, but
he could not find any one in London or Paris willing to
attempt it.</p>

<p>When a ball appears to cross or pass even from side to
side of the pelvis, it is not always easy to say whether it has
penetrated the cavity or not, until symptoms indicative of
such injury appear; the less done to such wounds the better.
When a ball enters, strikes a bone, and lodges, it is very desirable
to ascertain its situation, in order that it may be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
once removed, if it can possibly be done with but little comparative
danger; for balls which lodge in these flat bones
may often be removed, and the comfort of the patient assured
by a timely operation, instead of proving the source of
much torment and misery for many years by their being
allowed to remain.</p>

<p>The late Colonel Wade, one of the most distinguished
officers of his rank in Spain, was wounded at the battle of
Albuhera, in 1811, by a musket-ball on the left side; it
passed through the ilium, and was supposed to have narrowly
avoided opening into the cavity of the abdomen. It
could not be followed beyond the bone. The inflammatory
symptoms were subdued in the usual time, and he gradually
recovered his health, some pieces of bone coming away from
time to time. A small fungous protrusion and discharge continued
from the wound for several years, with a certain degree
of pain, and of occasional lameness in the leg and thigh.
The wound closed sometimes for a few months, and reopened
after an attack of pain, with great lameness and swelling of
the hip, and a discharge of matter from the original site.
An abscess at last formed under the gluteus maximus, and
was opened at its anterior and lower edge. This gave great
relief and prevented the irritation of the upper and anterior
original wound, the matter finding a more ready passage. I
often assured him I could distinguish the ball very deeply
seated; and in the summer of 1846, thirty-five years after
the receipt of the injury, it had descended so far that I
passed a probe under it at the distance of two inches and
a half from the lower opening. He was to have come to
London as early as his duties would possibly permit, in the
spring of 1847, to have had it removed, when he was suddenly
cut off by apoplexy, to the great regret of all who
knew him.</p>

<p>The late General Sir Hercules Packenham, G.C.B., was
wounded at the assault of Badajos by a musket-ball, April
6th, 1812, which deprived him of the use of the thumb and
little finger, and partially of the hand; and by another which
struck him on the right iliac region, passing in just below
Poupart’s ligament and outwardly through the ilium. Eight
pieces of bone came away at Elvas, and eleven more, in
1813, in London. He went to Baréges in 1814-15-16-17,
with the hope that the ball might be loosened and removed,
but in vain; it never could be found. A small quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
inoffensive glutinous matter, sometimes streaked with blood,
was discharged occasionally from the seat of the injury. At
times the wound became painful and very troublesome for a
week or ten days together, after which little inconvenience
was felt in the limb.</p>

<p>Colonel Sir J. M. Wilson, now of Chelsea Hospital, was
wounded in seven different places by three musket-balls on
the left hip, at the Chippewa, near the Falls of Niagara, on
the 5th of July, 1814. One, which struck him a little before
the trochanter, passed upward through the ilium, (from which
several pieces of bone came away on four or five different
occasions,) and lodged against or in the spinal column, rendering
the left leg quite powerless, and impairing the power
of the right. He fell. Shortly after an Indian warrior
came up, placed his foot on his neck, drew out his scalping-knife,
seized his hair, and was in the act of beginning to
scalp him, when a shot passed through his chest and laid
him prostrate by the side of his intended victim, who thus
happily escaped. The numbness and inability to put the
limb to the ground continued from eighteen months to two
years, during which time he was on crutches. After this he
gradually recovered, always suffering more or less. The
pain in the back is often most excruciating, coming on without
any apparent cause, except perhaps from change of
weather. He limps after walking a couple of miles, and if
exercise be continued, pain ensues. He married in 1824, has
several children, and is obliged to lead a very regular, quiet
life, without which he breaks down. The great suffering he
experiences, at the end of near forty years, is, however, from
the pain in the back, sense of coldness in the left leg, and
numbness accompanied by pain in the course of the nerves.
He is equally sensible to heat in a close atmosphere, which
he is obliged to avoid. The alvine and urinary secretions,
etc. have always been impaired or deranged since the wound
was received. He is troubled with painful affections and a
train of nervous feelings of the whole system, attributable
to the injury. The ball can of late be felt at the bottom of
a soft swelling in the loins; but the colonel, since the affair
of the Indian, has no predilection for cold steel, and protests
as loudly against the scalpel of the surgeon as the scalping-knife
of the Indian.</p>

<p>A soldier, of the Fourth Division of Infantry, was wounded
at the battle of Salamanca by a musket-ball, which entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
immediately above the right ilium, passed across, and made
its exit nearly opposite on the left side, going nearer to the
back than to the wall of the abdomen. He was supposed
to be killed, but had recovered a little life when brought to
me at the field hospital some hours afterward. The belly
was swollen, generally tympanitic, and some hemorrhage had
taken place from the wound of entrance, and he was unable
to move the leg of that side. On reaction taking place, he
was bled repeatedly, and treated antiphlogistically with the
aid of calomel, opium, and antimony. He was removed to
the San Domingo Hospital, and on the sixth day the bowels
were relieved naturally. A small quantity of fecal matter
was passed for several days with the discharge from the
wound, but this gradually ceased, and the man ultimately
recovered without any particular defect, except weakness
and occasional pain and derangement of bowels, on any
irregularity.</p>

<p>John Bryan, 1st Light Battalion of the King’s German
Legion, was wounded on the 17th of June near Quatre Bras
by a musket-ball, which entered at the groin, and made its
exit behind. He was transported to Brussels, with his foot
and leg in a state of mortification. Wine and other stimulants
were freely given, and he rallied a little on the 23d
and 24th. On the 25th, the stomach rejected everything
except brandy and opium. On the 26th, a line of separation
seemed to be about to form between the dead and the living
parts, although he was evidently failing. He died on the
28th, eleven days after the receipt of the injury. On examination
after death the ball was found to have completely
divided the external iliac artery; about a pint of coagulated
blood, mixed with some excessively fetid pus, was collected
in the pelvis; the ends of the wounded artery had receded
considerably from each other, and a coagulum had formed
in each, which was easily squeezed out, the orifice of the
upper end only being a little contracted. There were signs
of some peritoneal inflammation having taken place; the
intestines had not been wounded, and the ball, in passing
out, had splintered the upper edge of the back part of the
ilium.</p>

<p>General Sir Edward Packenham was killed instantaneously
at New Orleans, by hemorrhage from a nearly similar wound,
in which the common iliac artery was divided.</p>

<p>414. I have removed balls on different occasions which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
have lodged in the bones of the pelvis, and always with the
greatest advantage, when done early. I have seen much
evil result from their being allowed to remain, as they caused
not only frequent distress, but at last gave rise to disease in
the bone, derangement of the general health, and death.
When the ball can be felt impacted in the bone, incisions
through muscular parts of little consequence should not be
spared to expose it. If an error exists at this moment, it is
that too little is done, rather than too much. Too great
reliance is placed on the efforts of nature, and not enough
on the resources of art. The constant meddling with a
wound is not recommended; nevertheless, much may be
done by careful investigation from time to time, of which
La Motte gives a good example in his fifty-first observation.</p>

<p>A grenadier was wounded at the battle of Dettingen, in
1743, by a musket-ball, which entered above Poupart’s ligament,
near the opening of the external oblique muscle on
the left side, and lodged. Thirteen days after his reception
into the hospital at Landau, La Motte felt with the probe
what he thought was the ball lying on the outside of the
psoas muscle against the bone. He made the patient lie on
his face, and touched the foreign body every day in order to
loosen it. On the thirty-fifth day he was satisfied it was the
ball, and on the forty-fifth, after many attempts, it was at
last extracted. His fifty-second observation relates to a case
as nearly similar as possible to those of Sir H. Packenham
and Colonel Wade. He made several deep and long incisions
in search of the ball, which he could not find; the
wound became fistulous, and at the end of a year closed, in
all probability to reopen from time to time.</p>

<p>The difference in practice between 1743 and 1855 ought
to be, that in 1855 the ball should be found first, and the
deep and long incisions made afterward for its extraction;
which do not preclude any previous external openings that
may be necessary to facilitate the first examination.</p>

<p>Captain Campbell was wounded by a pistol-ball, on the
5th of September, 1805; it penetrated the abdomen on the
middle of the right side, and was extracted from nearly the
same situation on the left; from its irregular denticulated
shape, it would appear to have impinged against a vertebra.
He complained of violent pain in the loins and belly, with
numbness and pain of the left leg and thigh, and suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
also from the greatest oppression, anxiety, and sickness. An
enema was administered, and twenty-four ounces of blood
were taken from the arm; lower extremities nearly paralyzed;
anxiety and oppression great at night. Blood-letting
to ten ounces. Cannot pass his urine; hot fomentations;
and at twelve at night sixteen more ounces of blood were
drawn. At three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, had three motions, the two last containing
apparently a pint of pure blood. Pain and other
symptoms being urgent, eight ounces more blood were taken
away. At six <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, passed urine for the first time, highly
tinged with blood; has had two motions, also mixed with
blood. Pain continuing, ten ounces of blood were abstracted,
although occasionally almost fainting on any movement;
belly fomented. At eight at night, sixty drops of
laudanum. At ten, being very restless, twenty drops more,
which procured some sleep, although he vomited frequently;
belly relieved by the fomentation; three stools mixed with
blood.</p>

<p>Sept. 6th.&mdash;All the symptoms relieved; passes blood with
his urine; sickness and vomiting troublesome; pulse 90,
rather firm than feeble. One o’clock.&mdash;Complains of violent
pain in the left leg and thigh, belly, and loins; pulse 116,
full and strong. Blood-letting to sixteen ounces. Barley-water
with niter for common drink. Six <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>&mdash;Pulse 96;
bowels open, with discharge of blood; symptoms generally
relieved. Tincture of opium, twelve drops at night.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;Slept better; less pain; paralysis continues. In
the evening symptoms aggravated; lost twelve ounces of
blood; enema, etc. repeated; pulse 120.</p>

<p>9th, 10th, 11th, 12th.&mdash;Pulse 96; bowels open; urine
bloody; is generally better.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Wound of exit healed; urine bloody; bowels open.
Chicken-broth for the first time.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;The opening of entrance having nearly closed was
enlarged, and a free exit allowed for the matter.</p>

<p>Oct. 20th.&mdash;Wounds quite closed; is free from pain, is
able to move about the house on crutches; warm, stimulating
applications to the limbs seem to have given most relief.</p>

<p>Nov. 20th.&mdash;Paralytic affection gone; he can now mount
his horse, and has only a feeling of numbness and torpor in
the left leg and thigh.</p>

<p>415. The general opinion which formerly prevailed, that
<i>wounds of the bladder</i>, by musket-balls, were for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
part mortal, is now known to be erroneous. When the bladder
is wounded below, where it is not covered by the peritoneum,
persons do sometimes recover by what may be considered
the almost unaided efforts of nature. A large number
of cases came under my observation at Brussels and at
Antwerp, and many had already died. Persons rarely recover
in whom urine has found its way into the general
cavity of the abdomen. They generally die of inflammation
in from three to six days.</p>

<p>When the bladder is wounded where it is covered by the
peritoneum, and the opening or openings do not by some
accident permit the urine to flow into the cavity of the abdomen,
the patient may be free from immediate danger for a
short time, although very anxious and greatly depressed in
countenance and manner, and even sick to vomiting. The
pain is not commonly severe at first, and if he can make
water, which in all such cases it is desirable to prevent by
having recourse to the catheter, it is more or less colored or
mixed with blood. If the urine should not escape into the
cavity of the abdomen, the ordinary inflammation which
must necessarily ensue takes place and affects the internal
surface of the bladder. The desire to pass urine becomes
greater, and is frequently insupportable, while it can in some
cases be only passed by drops. In others these symptoms
are less urgent. Nevertheless, the natural action of the
bladder, or, in those severe cases, the additional efforts
which are made for its expulsion by the abdominal muscles,
may cause the urine to be forced through the wound into
the cavity of the abdomen, whence the advantage to be obtained
from the early use of the elastic catheter. When the
orifices of entrance and of exit are free, and low down in the
pelvis, the urine may run out without much immediate mischief
ensuing. But as this cannot always be known, an
elastic gum catheter should be introduced from the first and
fixed in the bladder, in every case where the nature of the
injury is doubtful, until the urine ceases to flow through the
wounds. It must, however, be recollected that in some
cases in which it has caused great irritation, by being introduced
too early, while the bladder was very sensitive, the
patients have been much relieved by its removal. The principle
is nevertheless incontrovertible in all doubtful cases;
the urine should be allowed to drop out of the catheter
nearly as fast as it passes into the bladder, when this organ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
is very irritable; great pains should also be taken that the
end of the instrument should be within, but not too far
within the bladder, so as to excite irritation by rubbing
against its sides, or to allow its end rising above the urine
which might in this way collect below it, and at last escape
through the wounds.</p>

<p>416. The inflammatory actions are to be subdued by general
bleeding, the application of leeches, the administration
of diluent drinks in moderate quantity, the exhibition of
gentle aperients, such as castor-oil, and by enemata. Opium
in all these cases is an important remedy, principally in the
shape of morphia. Opium in substance, when introduced into
the rectum in the shape of a suppository, or dissolved in
half an ounce or an ounce of water as an enema, should be
repeated in such quantities, beginning with two grains, as
will procure ease.</p>

<p>417. The urine, in most cases of injury below the peritoneum,
flows readily through the wound of entrance, if not
of exit, in the first instance, and care should be taken, by
enlarging the posterior wound, that no obstacle within reach
shall prevent it; but after inflammation has been established,
the parts swell, and as the sloughs begin to separate, its passage
is often obstructed; the elastic catheter, if not used before,
will then render important service by allowing the
sloughs to be separated without the healthy parts being
irritated by the urine being retained. After a time the
urine may be only drawn off in small quantities through the
catheter, as frequently as circumstances may render advisable.
The permanent use of the catheter in these cases will
often prevent the urine from forming any devious paths as it
proceeds outward, ending in abscesses and fistulous openings,
causing much discomfort and even misery. It is not
common for blood to be poured into the bladder in such a
quantity as to cause much inconvenience; it coagulates with
equal proportions of urine, and a silver catheter should be
used, by which it may be broken up and rendered more easy
of solution by injections of warm water. When the neck of
the bladder or the prostatic part of the urethra has been
divided so that a catheter cannot be efficiently used, surgery
must come with more immediate aid to the assistance of the
sufferer, by making a clear and free opening from the perineum
for the evacuation of the urine and of the discharge
from the wound. If a ball lodge in or near the bladder, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
in the prostate, it must be removed by an operation in the
perineum.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Light Division was wounded on the
heights of Vera, in the Pyrenees. A musket-ball had entered
behind near the sacrum and lodged. He was bled
twice, in consequence of suffering pain in the part, but was
not otherwise much disturbed. There was at first a difficulty
in passing urine, but this gradually subsided, although
he always suffered pain in micturition, which was frequent
and distressing. He remained in this state until December,
when he passed, with considerable effort and after much difficulty,
a hard piece of his jacket about half an inch in length,
larger than the orifice of the urethra, through which it was
forced. As it was not incased by calcareous matter, it could
not have been long in the bladder, but must have been lodged
near it before it ulcerated its way in, giving rise to the constant
desire and irritation which he had so long experienced.
His symptoms then subsided, although they had not entirely
disappeared when he left for England.</p>

<p>A French soldier was wounded by a musket-ball on the
back part of the right hip, at Almaraz, on the Tagus, was
taken prisoner, and sent to Lisbon in the autumn of 1813.
The ball had lodged, but gave him little inconvenience at
the time beyond some pain in the course of the sciatic nerve,
subsequently followed by defect of motion on the right side.
Four months after the injury pain came on about the region
of the bladder, with great desire to pass urine, which he could
not do when standing, but which dribbled away when lying
down. When quiet he suffered little, but great pain followed
any attempt at continued motion. A catheter could
be introduced, but with great difficulty when it reached the
prostate gland, which was exceedingly tender to the touch.
After a time the instrument could not be passed, and the
man was in great agony until something appeared to give
way, and a discharge of matter took place, when the urine
followed, and he was relieved. An abscess had formed, in
all probability from the proximity of the ball, which still
could not be felt. The man recovered, retaining, however,
his former state of lameness and defect of power, although
relieved from the vexatious irritation of the bladder.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Fourth Division of Infantry was wounded
at the battle of Toulouse, while entering a redoubt, by a
musket-ball, which entered at the left groin, and, crossing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
the pelvis, came out on the upper part of the opposite hip
behind. The urine flowed from both wounds and from the
rectum, indicating that the ball had passed between these
parts, and a little feces came from the posterior wound for
three weeks. The pain and suffering were not great, and
principally arose from retention of urine, requiring the use
of the catheter, which was left in, and changed from time to
time, until the urine flowed by the side of it, instead of
through the wounds, which it did occasionally for some
weeks in drops, but not in any quantity; after which the
wounds gradually closed, and the man was sent to England
cured.</p>

<p>A soldier of the Cavalry of the King’s German Legion
was struck, at the battle of Salamanca, by a musket-ball,
which entered just above the pubes a little to the right side,
and came out below on the opposite nates. The urine
flowed readily through both wounds for the first three days,
and he suffered afterward from great pain and distress about
the region of the bladder, from which he could not expel
any urine, neither would it pass by either wound. I immediately
introduced a catheter, drew off a moderate quantity
of urine, and then fixed it in the bladder, desiring him to
draw off his urine every hour when awake. This he did,
often leaving the stopper out at night. The urine flowed
after a few days through the posterior wound, and then
ceased. The catheter was washed from time to time, and
was at last withdrawn, as the urine began to flow by the side
of it, and the wound had finally closed when he left the San
Domingo Hospital.</p>

<p>Captain Martin received a wound from a musket-ball at
the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo; it entered just above the
pubes, passed through the bladder and rectum, and came out
behind, splintering the sacrum, the contents of both viscera
being freely discharged through this opening. As he suffered
but little inconvenience from the urine, very little of
which passed by the urethra, that passage was not interfered
with in the first instance. Inflammatory symptoms were kept
within due bounds, the rectum was carefully washed out by
emollient enemata, and his food rendered as light as possible.
Under this treatment he gradually improved; the anterior
wound first healed, and subsequently the posterior
one, leaving him comparatively well when he left me for
Lisbon on his way to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
418. These cases give, however, a brighter view of the
nature of these wounds than they frequently justify; extravasation
of urine, inflammation, and death are not of infrequent
occurrence in cases to which strict attention is not
paid; and great misery is often caused from the irritation
of the bladder and the discharge which follows, until the
constitution is undermined and death ensues.</p>

<p>Captain Sleigh, of the 100th Regiment, was wounded at
the battle of Chippewa, on the 5th of July, 1814, by a musket-ball,
which entered the left groin immediately over Poupart’s
ligament, by the side of the spermatic vessels, injuring
in its course the anterior brim of the pelvis. It thence
passed through the bladder obliquely across the pelvis, and
terminated its course beneath the integuments in the right
buttock, whence it was immediately extracted. Blood and
urine flowed incessantly from the groin; the quantity of
blood lost was considerable. He complained much of pain
in the hypogastric region; the abdomen was tense and painful
to the touch, and he had an almost continued inclination
to micturate; but his attempts, after the most painful efforts,
were entirely frustrated. The anxiety was great, the respiration
hurried, and the pulse quick and fluttering. He was
bled to the extent of thirty ounces; an enema was given;
fomentations applied to the belly; and the catheter introduced&mdash;all
which afforded him some relief. The next day
he was removed to the rear, a distance of seventeen miles,
in an open wagon, partly during the inclemency of the night,
and was quite worn out by so long a journey. He was carried
thence on board ship, and landed at York on the morning
of the 9th of July, the fourth day after he received his
wound.</p>

<p>July 9th.&mdash;Abdomen tense and painful to the touch; severe
pain in the perineum; great inclination to void urine,
but fruitlessly; wound in the groin sloughy, discharges urine
and blood mixed with a small quantity of pus; posterior
wound healthy, no discharge of urine from it; catheter attempted
to be passed without success. Ordered an ounce
and a half of castor-oil immediately.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Passed a restless night; had two copious stools;
voided a few drops of urine by the urethra; still great inclination
to pass urine. Ordered two grains of extract of
opium made into a pill.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;All the painful sensations much relieved; abdomen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
less tense; a small piece of bone extracted from the urethra
about an inch in length, of the thickness of a crow-quill; a
little urine followed more freely.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Complains of severe pain in the spermatic cord;
discharge from groin more offensive; wound filled with large
maggots; bowels open.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;Wound of groin looks clean; a small piece of
bone discharged by the urethra, and a piece of cloth extracted
from the groin.</p>

<p>24th.&mdash;A small piece of bone extracted from the groin.</p>

<p>August 5th.&mdash;Passes a good deal of pus and urine by the
urethra.</p>

<p>29th.&mdash;Posterior wound much inflamed and very painful
upon pressure. A poultice to be frequently applied.</p>

<p>Sept. 1st.&mdash;An abscess has burst; a piece of cloth has
been extracted; urine and pus are discharged by both
wounds.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Doing well; wounds closing.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Bladder resuming its power; discharge of matter
from groin very trivial.</p>

<p>Oct. 4th.&mdash;Posterior wound closed.</p>

<p>30th.&mdash;Wound of groin closed; urine, passed by the natural
passage, mixed with pus.</p>

<p>At first it was supposed that only the fundus of the bladder
was wounded; but when the collection of matter took
place in the right buttock, and a piece of cloth was extracted
from it, the urine following, it was evident that both sides of
the bladder had been transfixed by the ball; and that, probably,
the urine from the commencement had been prevented
flowing posteriorly by the intervention of this foreign body.
An elastic gum catheter could not be passed into the bladder
on account of the piece of bone which had forced its way
into the urethra, and from its being obstructed afterward by
smaller pieces of bone.</p>

<p>When I saw this gentleman some time afterward, it appeared
to me that the purulent discharge from the urethra
was not from the inner membrane of the bladder, but was
probably caused by some dead bone of the pelvis having a
communication with the bladder by a fistulous opening.</p>

<p>A soldier, of the King’s German Legion, was struck, at
Waterloo, by a musket-ball, which entered a little way above
the pubes, and lodged. The symptoms which immediately
followed were by no means severe, although he passed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
little bloody urine at first; the external wound closed without
difficulty. He complained of pain at the neck of the
bladder, and had a great desire to pass urine, with other
signs of stone in the bladder, which induced me to pass a
sound, when I found that the ball was lying loose in that
viscus. On his arrival at the York Hospital, at Chelsea,
from Brussels, he became, with the French soldier, whose
thigh had been amputated at the hip-joint, an object of great
attention. I performed the operation for the removal of the
ball in the presence of a large concourse of military and medical
persons. It was done in less than two minutes; but the
calculus, composed of the triple phosphates, which had formed
around the ball, yielded, and broke under the forceps. The
pieces were removed separately. The ball, being heavy, fell
below the neck of the bladder, which, being healthy, yielded
to the pressure, and allowed it to sink on the rectum, where
it could not be caught by the forceps, until it had been raised
by a finger in the bowel. The bladder was then well washed
out, so as to remove all the pieces that might remain, and
the man was placed in bed. He was bled once in consequence
of some apprehension of pain; but he had not a bad
symptom, and rapidly recovered.</p>

<p>The symptoms of irritation did not, however, entirely pass
away, as could have been wished, and I began to fear that
some small pieces of calculus had been overlooked; when,
one morning, after considerable effort, he passed a ring of
sandy calcareous matter, which had formed around the orifice
of the bladder, and which, being dislodged, had fortunately
entered the urethra, along which it was forced by the
urine. It was evidently formed of the phosphates in minute
portions, which had become agglutinated together, around
the meatus of the bladder. This he took with him to Hanover,
where it, himself, and the cicatrixes of his wound, and
of his operation, attracted great notice. The ball, which was
flattened on one side, I kept in a small box, together with
the pieces of calculus which were extracted, and showed
them annually at my lecture on this subject for many years.
One evening, however, I unfortunately left my little box on
the table after lecture; and when I recollected, and returned
for it, I found that some gentleman had borrowed it, and has
not yet returned it. At the battle of Chillianwallah a similar
wound took place; the ball formed the nucleus of a calculus,
and was removed successfully by a gentleman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
service of the East India Company, whose name I have not
been able to learn.</p>

<p>The following case, from Baron Percy, is in point: A
young man was wounded by a pistol-shot, which entered
just above the os pubis, through the linea alba, wounded the
bladder, and lodged. The belly swelled; a tumor formed
in the perineum; no urine passed; the bowels were confined,
and fever ran high, with a tendency to delirium. Believing
that the tumor in the perineum, and the fluctuation he
thought he perceived, might be caused by extravasated urine,
he punctured it with a trocar, and evacuated a large quantity
of bloody urine. This induced him to enlarge the opening,
and carry it on to the bladder, through which he brought
out the ball, some shirt, and several clots of blood. The
man was bled nine times in all; the urine after a time passed
in the ordinary way, and the patient slowly recovered.</p>

<p>An officer was wounded near Bayonne, by a musket-ball,
on the left side; it passed through the ilium across the pubes,
and made its exit through the gluteus maximus of the opposite
side, but lower down. Urine flowed through both
wounds at first very readily, but none of any moment came by
the urethra, from which some blood occasionally oozed. The
attempt to pass a catheter failed, although the desire to
make water was urgent and painful. After a few days the
passage of urine by the external wounds became obstructed,
apparently by the sloughs; great pain and misery were experienced;
fever ran high; rigors and delirium followed
extravasation of urine, and death closed the scene. The
mischief here arose from the catheter not having been passed
into the bladder, which could not be effected, from the prostatic
part of the urethra or the neck of the bladder having
been injured.</p>

<p>419. Surgery in such, or in nearly similar cases, requires
a catheter or staff to be passed down the urethra as far as it
will go; an incision should then be made upon it, from the
center or across the perineum, and the urethra divided on
the staff until the finger rests upon the wounded parts, when,
in all probability, a straight catheter, with the aid of the
forefinger in the rectum, can be carried through them into
the bladder. The urine will then have a direct passage
outward, instead of coming indirectly from the bladder by
the wounds. If the straight catheter cannot be passed, which
can scarcely occur, the central incision is to be continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
from the point of obstruction into the bladder, guided by the
finger in the rectum. A free opening from the bladder offers
the only hope of safety.</p>

<p>420. The <i>rectum</i> may be wounded without any other
organ being injured within the pelvis; of this I have seen
several instances. Captain Gordon, of the navy, was struck
by a rifle-ball toward the lower part of one side of the sacrum,
after being knocked down by one he had received on the
head, and by another in the neck and back. The ball, which
passed into the rectum, made its exit on the opposite side
of the sacrum, and stercoraceous matters were evacuated by
both wounds. The pain was severe; the limbs were deprived
of much of their power of motion, and the next day
the bladder was incapable of expelling its contents. This
was relieved by the catheter, and the rectum was kept clear
by warm, mild enemata, while the inflammatory symptoms
were subdued by bleeding, opium, starvation, and rest. At
the end of three months he was able to walk, but with some
difficulty, on account of defective power in one leg. Some
small pieces of bone came away and the wounds closed, although
he was subject to an occasional slight opening of the
orifice of entrance, from which a little matter was discharged,
when it again closed. He remained more or less lame until
his death, which took place with the loss of the ship he commanded,
in a hurricane, on the coast of North America.</p>

<p>A French soldier was wounded at the battle of Salamanca
by a ball, which entered by the side of the sacrum, and lodged.
Having been rode over and bruised, he was taken prisoner,
and brought to me on the field of battle. From this wound
he suffered comparatively little, except from a difficulty of
passing urine. On the third day after his arrival at the San
Carlos Hospital, or the sixth from the receipt of the injury,
he passed the ball per anum. The wound quickly closed,
and he aided his comrades as an orderly in the hospital
afterward.</p>

<h3 class="center">CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>421.&mdash;1. Severe blows on the abdomen give rise to the
absorption of the muscular structures, and the formation of
ventral hernia, in many instances; this may, in some measure,
be prevented during the treatment, by quietude, by the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
abstraction of blood, and by the early use of retaining bandages.</p>

<p>2. Abscesses in the muscular wall of the abdomen, from
whatever cause they arise, should be opened early; for
although the peritoneum is essentially strong by its outer
surface, it is but a thin membrane, and should be aided
surgically as much as possible.</p>

<p>3. Severe blows, attended by general concussion, frequently
give rise to rupture of the solid viscera, such as the
liver and the spleen, causing death by hemorrhage. When
the hollow viscera are ruptured, such as the intestines or the
bladder, death ensues from inflammation.</p>

<p>4. Incised wounds of the wall of the abdomen to any
extent rarely unite so perfectly (except, perhaps, in the
linea alba) as not to give rise to ventral protrusions of a
greater or less extent.</p>

<p>5. As the muscular parts rarely unite in the first instance
after being divided, sutures should never be introduced into
these structures.</p>

<p>6. Muscular parts are to be brought into apposition, and
so retained principally by position, aided by a continuous
suture through the integuments only, together with long
strips of adhesive plaster, moderate compression, and sometimes
a retaining bandage.</p>

<p>7. Sutures should never be inserted through the whole
wall of the abdomen, and their use in muscular parts under
any circumstances is forbidden; unless the wound, from its
very great extent, cannot be otherwise sufficiently approximated
to restrain the protrusion of the contents of the
cavity. The occurrence of such a case is very rare.</p>

<p>8. Purgatives should be eschewed in the early part of the
treatment of penetrating wounds of the abdomen. Enemata
are to be preferred.</p>

<p>9. The omentum, when protruded, is to be returned by
enlarging the wound through its aponeurotic parts if necessary,
but not through the peritoneum, in preference to
allowing it to remain protruded, or to be cut off.</p>

<p>10. A punctured intestine requires no immediate treatment.
An intestine, when incised to an extent exceeding
the third part of an inch, should be sewn up by the continuous
suture in the manner recommended, <i>Aph.</i> 391.</p>

<p>11. The position of the patient should be inclined toward
the wounded side, to allow the omentum or intestine being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
closely applied to the cut edges of the peritoneum. Absolute
rest, without the slightest motion, should be observed.
Food and drink should be restricted, when not entirely forbidden.</p>

<p>12. If the belly swell, and the propriety of allowing extravasated
or effused matters to be evacuated seem to be
manifest, the continuous suture or stitches should be cut
across to a certain extent, for the purpose of giving this
relief.</p>

<p>13. If the punctured or incised wound be small, and the
extravasation or effusion within the cavity seem to be great,
the wound should be carefully enlarged, and the offending
matter evacuated.</p>

<p>14. A wound should not be closed until it has ceased to
bleed, or until the bleeding vessel has been secured, if it be
possible to do so. When it is not possible so to do, the
wound should be closed, and the result awaited.</p>

<p>15. A gunshot wound penetrating the cavity can never
unite, and must suppurate. If a wounded intestine can be
seen or felt, its torn edges may be cut off, and the clean surfaces
united by suture. If the wound can neither be seen
nor felt, it will be sufficient for the moment to provide for
the free discharge of any extravasated or effused matters
which may require removal.</p>

<p>16. A dilatation or enlargement of a wound in the abdomen
should never take place, unless in connection with something
within the cavity rendering it necessary.</p>

<p>17. If the epigastric, circumflexa ilii, or other artery in
the wall of the abdomen, be injured and bleed, the wound
should be enlarged, and the bleeding vessel secured by ligature.
If the main trunk or the external iliac artery be sought
for and tied, the patient will in all probability die.</p>

<p>18. When balls lodge in the bones of the pelvis, they
should be carefully sought for and removed, if it can be done
with propriety and safety.</p>

<p>19. In a wound of the bladder, an elastic gum catheter
should be kept in the urethra, frequently without a stopper,
until the wound is presumed to be healed&mdash;unless its presence
should prove injurious, from excess of irritation, not removed
by allowing the urine to pass through it by drops as
it is brought into the bladder.</p>

<p>20. In all cases in which a catheter cannot be introduced,
in consequence of the back part of the urethra or the neck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
of the bladder being injured, an opening for the discharge
of the urine should be made from the perineum into the
bladder. It is essential to the preservation of life.</p>

<p>21. The treatment of all these injuries must be eminently
antiphlogistic, principally depending on general and local
blood-letting, absolute rest, abstinence from food, and in
some cases almost even from drink, the frequent administration
of enemata, and the early exhibition of mercury, and
especially of opium, in the different ways usually recommended,
with reference to the part injured.</p>

<p>422. As the operation for opening into the colon may be
necessary, after an injury of that part, as well as from disease
below it, the following method, recommended by Mr.
Hilton, is briefly transcribed from the Reports of Guy’s
Hospital. A line drawn parallel to the spinous processes
directly downward from the angle of the seventh, eighth,
or ninth rib across the costo-iliac space to the crest of the
ilium, will correspond with the outer edge of the erector
spinæ muscle and the apices of the transverse processes. A
measured inch outwardly corresponds with the outer edge of
the quadratus lumborum muscle. A vertical incision, two
inches long, made at the extremity of the measured inch,
should divide the skin, cellular tissue, and the tendon of the
internal oblique muscle, and expose the outer edge of the
quadratus lumborum muscle. Any bleeding vessels to be
secured. The last dorsal nerve, if seen lying across the
upper part of the incision, should be divided, to prevent the
occurrence of pain from its being engaged in the cicatrix.
The transversalis abdominis muscle is then to be divided
vertically to nearly the same extent of two inches, parallel
to the edge of the quadratus, when a quantity of loose lobulated
fat will be seen, which should be partly removed and
partly displaced by the blunt end of a director, in the vertical
direction of the original incision, when the intestine will
be brought into view. Any bleeding vessels should be
secured, and pressure made on the abdomen, which will
cause the intestine to become more prominent at the bottom
of the incision. A silk ligature is now to be passed into the
bowel and through the integuments at the upper part, so as
to fix the intestine above, when a second ligature is to be
applied in a similar manner below. The intestine is then to
be opened between them, care being taken to apply another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
ligature above and below it, if the intestine should not appear
to be firmly held in its place. If a vessel in its wall
should bleed, it must be tied. Inflammation, pain, and restlessness
should be obviated as far as possible by fomentations,
opiates, and diaphoretics, and strict attention paid to
cleanliness and the comfort of the patient, until the first
symptoms have passed away, and he is able to assume the
erect position.</p>

<p>423. These commentaries are restricted to those points
which constitute, in a great degree, what the French call
<i>la haute chirurgie</i>. They are published that every soldier
should have the opportunity of knowing how he ought to
be treated, when suffering for a country not too grateful for
the services rendered by her bravest sons; and I have labored
with the hope that some few of them, when they find that
their limbs, perhaps their lives, have been saved under the
precepts I have laid down, may acknowledge, when I am
beyond that bourn whence no traveler returns, that they
owe them, under the will of God, to those efforts I, more
than any one else, have made, and continue to make, for the
adoption of that practice which led to their preservation.</p>

<hr class="r5" />
<p>Several reports and cases having reached me from various
medical officers in the Crimea, too late for publication
in their proper places, I have thought it best to notice some
generally as to results, others particularly. Chloroform has
been freely administered in all the Divisions of the army
save the Second, and has been generally approved; one
death only, as far as is known, having occurred directly from
its administration, of which Staff-Surgeon Gordon, P.M.O.
of the Second Division, has favored me with the following
report:&mdash;</p>

<p>Martin Kennedy, 62d Regiment, aged 32 years, a healthy
soldier, having accidentally wounded one of his fingers by
his musket going off, and the medical officer in charge considering
it necessary to remove it, was brought under the
influence of chloroform, but, according to his (the surgeon’s)
statement, only about ʒij could have been inhaled. He had
commenced the operation, when the patient suddenly expired.
On the post-mortem examination, beyond a little
fatty deposit on the external surface of the left ventricle,
together with a degree of hypertrophy of the same, no morbid
appearance existed. The usual restoratives were resorted
to, but ineffectually.</p>

<p>The following case, furnished by Assistant-Surgeon Hannan,
49th Regiment, is given as an illustration of the
success of amputation without chloroform in the Second
Division:&mdash;</p>

<p>Patrick Kenny, 49th Regiment, aged 22. This soldier,
while on duty in the trenches on the 21st of July, received
a compound comminuted fracture of the right humerus, extending
from its middle third to the head of the bone. The
integuments of the outer and upper part of the shoulder
were carried away. There was also a contused and lacer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>ated
wound of the left knee, opening into the joint, with
comminuted fracture of the patella, these injuries being
caused by pieces of shell. He was seen a quarter of an
hour after admission by Dr. Gordon, P.M.O., who removed
the arm at the shoulder-joint, making a sufficient flap from
the integuments of the axilla. The thigh was then amputated
in its lower third. These operations were performed
in immediate succession without the administration of chloroform.
The thigh healed nearly by the first intention&mdash;all
the ligatures having come away by the fourteenth day. The
shoulder healed by granulation&mdash;the ligature of the axillary
artery coming away on the twenty-first day. During the
progress of treatment he had not any constitutional disturbance
further than three slight attacks of diarrhœa. He is
now up and about, and goes to England by the next opportunity.</p>

<p>In the worst cases of amputation at the hip-joint, or at
the upper third of the thigh, chloroform has appeared to
cause insensibility to pain without diminishing the powers of
the sufferer, when given with due caution or not carried so
far as to affect the pulse or respiration. (See <i>Aphor.</i> 51.)
The evidence on this point is sufficient to authorize surgeons
to administer it in all such cases, with the expectation that
it will always prove advantageous, an accidental death, such
as has been observed from its use, being independent of the
nature of the injury. The amputations performed at the
hip-joint, at least six in number, have not been successful as
to the result, although the sufferers bore them well in the
first instance, offering every prospect of recovery for days
and even for weeks.</p>

<p>Deputy Inspector-General Taylor informs me, and his
opinion is corroborated by all the medical officers, that the
labors the troops had to perform, the privations they suffered,
the frequent insufficiency of their food, the want of
proper clothing, with other depressing causes, had so deprived
them of that power British soldiers generally possess,
that all the operations of importance performed on the
lower extremities were more or less unsuccessful, while those
on the upper were as remarkable for their success. This
deprivation of power, it is said, was even more observable in
the French army; and he informs me that most of their
surgeons had declined performing any of the great operations
usually done on the upper third of the thigh, in conse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>quence
of their almost certain failure, preferring to let the
injuries take their course, even unto the death of the sufferers,
rather than hasten their dissolution by any operation
usually considered and often found to be conservative; a
lamentable state of things from which governments may
draw an inference of the utmost importance, viz., that to
guard against the effects of disease as well as of injuries,
the utmost pains should be taken to preserve the health and
maintain the vigor of their soldiers. A matter of expense
as well as of arrangement.</p>

<p>This statement is corroborated by Deputy Inspector-General
Alexander, who informed me, on the 3d of August, 1855,
that “during the whole of this campaign, where we have
had ample opportunities of testing the use of chloroform,
both after the battles of the Alma and Inkerman, as well
as throughout the whole siege operations before Sebastopol,
up to the present period, no operations whatever of any
consequence (save with one or two exceptions, and then at
the patients’ own request,) have been performed in the Light
Division, without first placing the patient under the influence
of chloroform, and in no single instance have either the
medical officers of the Division, or myself, seen any bad results
follow, or had to reject its use, but quite the contrary.
Of course, in such a campaign, many operations of the most
serious character, both on the upper and lower extremities,
have been performed in the Division by the different medical
officers as well as by myself. At the Alma, I operated upon
three patients at the hip-joint, two being our own men and
the third a Russian. All the three patients were first placed
under chloroform, with the results above stated. In the case
of a soldier of the 90th Regiment, whose right arm I removed
at the shoulder-joint on the 10th of July, for great
destruction of the soft parts and extensive injury to the
humerus, the patient was so low when placed on the table
that brandy and water was given to him, and he was then
immediately afterward placed under chloroform. When I
had finished, it was found that his pulse was stronger than
before commencing the operation. In Sir T. Trowbridge’s
case, in which I had to remove both feet, one at the ankle-joint
and the other above it, he was placed under chloroform
for both operations, a few minutes having been allowed to
elapse before giving it to him again for the second operation,
and with the best results. Both feet were much injured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
by round shot, the bones of both being completely smashed
with great destruction of the soft parts, so much so, that in
the case at the ankle-joint I had to form the flap from the
cushion of the heel. I, however, did not remove the articular
surface of the lower end of the tibia, as recommended by
Mr. Syme, and the wound healed well. Of the three cases
mentioned at the hip-joint, two were performed on the 21st,
and the Russian on the 22d of September. At one of the
former I was assisted by the late Dr. Mackenzie, from Edinburgh.
All three were carried down on the 22d, to be
placed on board ships for conveyance to Scutari. It has
been reported to me that one of the two operated on, on the
21st, Peter Sullivan, 33d Regiment, died at Scutari General
Hospital on the 11th of October, three weeks from the date
of the operation, ‘from excessive debility.’ Nothing could
be ascertained about Peter Cleary, 23d Fusiliers; it is therefore
most likely that he died on the passage.</p>

<p>“The Russian died on the 22d of October, ‘from great
debility and extensive sloughing.’</p>

<p>“A shoulder-joint case in the 90th Regiment never had a
bad symptom, and the wound is all but healed. The flap in
this case was made from the axillary portion of the arm,
the deltoid having been all but destroyed.</p>

<p>“The flap operation has been invariably performed in the
Light Division, with but two exceptions, viz., one of the
arm and the other of the thigh.”</p>

<p>Excision of the head, neck, and trochanter of the femur,
with portions of the shaft, has been performed at least six
times before Sebastopol. The result has been unfavorable
in five, although in all there were well-grounded expectations
of success for weeks. In one case by Mr. Blenkins, of
the Grenadier Guards, he informs me, it was for the first
three or four weeks very favorable. The man, however, sank
at the end of the fifth week from deposition of matter in the
knee-joint. (See p. 42 et seq.) Of the second case, which
occurred in the general hospital in the camp and ended
fatally, I have no further notice. The third, in the 68th
Regiment, in charge of Mr. O’Leary, the operation performed
on the 19th of August, was going on most favorably
on the 5th of October.</p>

<p>Private Thomas M’Kenena, aged twenty-five, was struck
by a fragment of shell, on the 19th of August, over the great
trochanter of the left femur. The wound, nearly an inch in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
length, extended down to the bone, which was distinctly
fractured. Some loose scales could be felt at the bottom of
the wound. On examination, the injury appeared to be a
transverse fracture of the neck of the thigh-bone, apparently
involving the joint.</p>

<p>After a consultation with superior medical officers, it was
decided that excision should be performed, which was done
without difficulty. No vessels required ligature, although
the man lost a considerable quantity of blood.</p>

<p>The excised parts, which are herewith forwarded, show
that the nature of the injury was different from what it was
supposed to be, and that the head of the bone was intact.</p>

<p>After the wound, about five inches long, had been sewn
up, the limb was placed in a sling made of strong canvas,
and was swung from a beam over the man’s cot, the bed
being raised.</p>

<p>This method of treatment was adopted with a view to encourage
approximation of the upper end of the bone to the
pelvis, and by pressure on the sides of the limb to prevent
the accumulation of matter among the tissues. The man
progresses favorably.</p>

<p>Diet was very generous.</p>

<p>The bones removed are in the museum of the Royal College
of Surgeons.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>The fourth case is given at length by Staff-Surgeon Crerar,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Private William Smith, First Battalion First Royals, was
brought to hospital from the Greenhill trenches, in front of
Sebastopol, about twelve <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, on the 6th of August. On
questioning him, I ascertained that an hour or so before he
was struck by a fragment of an exploded grenade, which
first broke into small pieces a water canteen which was suspended
over the left hip, and then made an opening or wound
about the size of a shilling nearly a quarter of an inch posterior
to the great trochanter. Crepitus was quite distinct
on moving the limb; and I easily ascertained, on exploring
the wound with my finger, that a fracture through the trochanter
had taken place, but was quite unable to ascertain
to what extent upward and downward the fracture extended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
I accordingly solicited a consultation with Deputy Inspector-General
Taylor and Staff-Surgeon Paynter. After a careful
examination, (the patient being under the influence of chloroform,)
the femur was discovered to be comminuted. Excision
at the hip-joint being recommended by these officers,
in which opinion I concurred, I proceeded to perform the
operation by commencing an incision, nine inches in length,
in a line with and two inches posterior to the anterior superior
spinous process of the ilium, and carrying it down in a
straight line directly over the trochanter major; a second
incision about two and a half inches in length was made,
commencing immediately below the trochanter backward
through the gluteus maximus; by a little easy dissection
the seat of fracture was exposed, the trochanter was found
broken into several portions, detached and imbedded in the
contused muscles around, from which they were at once removed.
The fracture was found to extend obliquely inward
about an inch and a half along the shaft of the bone. The
femur was now protruded through the wound, and I sawed
off the whole of the fractured bone, leaving a smooth, clean
surface; I then proceeded to disarticulate the head of the
femur, which was effected without difficulty. Scarcely three
ounces of blood were lost, and little or no shock was induced;
only one small bleeding point was secured near the
tail of the wound, and the divided parts were brought together
by two sutures and bands of adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>At twelve <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, two hours after the operation on the 7th
instant, his pulse being rather feeble, he was ordered some
wine and water.</p>

<p>7th, vespere.&mdash;Countenance cheerful, voice strong; says
he intends keeping up his pluck, and is sure he will get well;
has no inclination to take the beef-tea ordered for him, but
has had some arrow-root and wine. To have a morphia
draught at bedtime.</p>

<p>8th.&mdash;Passed a good night; limb in a good position; retracted
about two inches; wound looks healthy; pulse 100,
soft; has made urine freely; skin moist; bowels were opened
freely in the night.</p>

<p>9th.&mdash;Slept well at night; says that he feels very comfortable;
skin moist; pulse 120; sutures were removed, and the
wound allowed to gape; it has a remarkably healthy appearance.
To go on with the simple water dressing, chicken-broth,
arrow-root, and wine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
Vespere.&mdash;Has been very cheerful all day; limb has retracted
about another half inch; pulse 112.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Passed a more restless night, in consequence of
not having the morphia draught as early as the previous
night; has had several hours’ sleep this morning, and is more
refreshed; pulse, on waking, from 114 to 120, skin comfortable;
no sign of distress in his aspect; wound suppurating
healthily; bowels were opened again once last night.</p>

<p>10th, vespere.&mdash;Has been very easy all day; skin cool;
tongue normal; pulse 120, soft and regular; has had to-day
two eggs, one ounce of arrow-root, two gills of wine, and
two pints of chicken-broth, all of which he relished much.
To have a grain of acetate of morphia in solution at bedtime.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;Slept soundly all night; when I visited him, at
six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, he had just awoke; pulse 115, soft; appears contented
and comfortable.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;Doing well; wound continues to look healthy;
position of limb good; has consumed a fair quantity of
chicken-broth, beef-tea, arrow-root, and three gills of sherry
to-day; pulse 113 at eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>12th.&mdash;Bowels were opened in the night; the introduction
of the bed-pan gave him a good deal of annoyance; the air
of the hut was rather stagnant last night, and he did not
sleep as well as usual; pulse 120, soft; tongue continues
clean and moist; there is more discharge from the wound
to-day.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;The progress of the case is most satisfactory;
had a fresh egg, tea, and toast for breakfast, his own selection,
which he appeared to relish greatly; at twelve he had
two mutton-chops and a glass of wine, and at five <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, a
pint of chicken-broth, with bread, and a second glass of wine.
The morphia draught as usual.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Continues to look happy and contented. Healthy-looking
granulations are evident over two-thirds of the
wound; swelling of limb subsiding; discharge from wound
healthy; pulse 114, regular and soft; all the symptoms are
so very favorable that I have every reason to expect a successful
issue.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;A small slough at the lower part of the wound, remainder
healthy and clean; tongue a little too dry this morning,
and he has more thirst than usual; pulse 118. To have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
effervescing draughts of bicarbonate of potassa and citric acid
three times a day; to continue simple water dressing.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;Thirst not so urgent; tongue cleaner and
moister; has a feeling of fullness in the abdomen. To have
his usual morphia draught and an ounce of castor-oil at bedtime.</p>

<p>15th.&mdash;Passed three large stools in the night, with great
relief; aspect resigned, and his spirits continue good; slough
has come away; pulse 118, soft and regular; skin tolerably
cool.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;Felt a good deal exhausted to-day from the
heat, which was very great&mdash;ninety-two degrees.</p>

<p>16th.&mdash;Looks heavy and out of spirits this morning; discharge
has increased, but is of a better quality since the
slough separated; tongue dry, inclined to brown; pulse the
same, skin rather hot; continue effervescing draughts every
third hour.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;Tongue more moist, less thirst. When asked
how he felt, he replied, with a great deal of life in his countenance,
“I am very well, and I feel very comfortable;”
asked for a mutton-chop early in the day, which he got, and
appeared to like; he had at different times in the day arrow-root,
chicken-broth, and wine.</p>

<p>17th.&mdash;Wound looks very healthy, and the general symptoms
very favorable to-day; tongue clean and moist; less
thirst; skin cooler; had him removed to a fresh bed without
a great deal of pain or trouble; limb retracted less than three
inches; position now good since he was shifted.</p>

<p>18th.&mdash;Very much worse this morning; had a rigor about
ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> yesterday; features now sharpened and pinched;
tongue dry and brown; pulse thready, about 125.</p>

<p>Vespere.&mdash;Continues in a very low state; wound has a
very healthy appearance; discharge healthy, but not as
abundant as it was; has had besides wine, a pint and a half
of porter, mutton-broth, and a chop to-day; zinc lotion to
the wound.</p>

<p>19th.&mdash;When I visited him at six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to-day, I was much

20th.&mdash;Looking rather pale, and features pinched; pulse
better, about 100, soft; skin cool; tongue more coated than
usual, inclined to be dry. I fear this case is a bad one, not
likely to terminate as we so much desire.</p>

dry.</p>

<p>21st, six <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;Has just awoke, having been asleep since
nine last night; says that he feels stronger; aspect certainly
improved since the last visit; coating on the tongue thicker,
brown; the pulse has more strength than it had yesterday;
no feeling of uneasiness; wound looking remarkably well,
and discharging laudable pus; asks for cold drinks; to have
his choice of iced soda, tamarind, toast or rice water; diet
the same as yesterday.&mdash;Eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>: has fallen off very
much since the morning, features pinched and blue; pulse
irregular, small, and wiry.&mdash;Twelve nocte: continues to sink;
died at half-past twelve <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Examination of the limb six hours after death.&mdash;Cut surfaces
of femur perfectly smooth; bone easily denuded of its
periosteum; acetabulum smooth; muscles infiltrated with
pus; nature had not made the slightest attempt to repair
the loss.</p>

<p>What would the result have been if amputation at the hip-joint
had been performed? The same. The vis medicatrix
naturæ is not sufficient to carry our sick through such formidable
operations; it is no fault of the surgeons. A better
and a more liberal allowance of animal and vegetable food
during health is required, if England expects her soldiers to
survive severe operations, disease and wounds. An attempt
to save the limb, for the very same reason, would, most undoubtedly,
have been a failure. Our Minié rifle-ball fractures
of the femur all sink under conservative surgery. Our
amputations above the middle of the thigh have a like issue;
it is truly disheartening.</p>

Corporal Benjamin Shehan, 41st Regiment, advanced with
his corps, about twelve o’clock, on the 8th of September, to
storm the Redan. Having succeeded in getting into the
work, the regiment was afterward obliged to retire; in the
retreat to our trenches he was wounded, and lay on the field
till the following day, when he was brought to the hospital
of the Royal Sappers and Miners. On examining the wound,
it was found that a grape-shot had entered at the great trochanter,
and, passing inward and a little forward, had passed
out at the groin of the same side, about an inch below Poupart’s
ligament, externally to, and a little in front of, the
femoral vessels. The lower fragment of the fracture protruded
through the external wound, and the introduction of
the finger discovered a comminuted state of the neck of the
bone.</p>

<p>Excision of the joint having been decided on, the operation
was performed in the presence of Deputy Inspector-General
Taylor, Staff-Surgeon Dr. Paynter, and Surgeon Elliot,
Ordnance Department.</p>

<p>Operation performed about one <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> 9th of September.&mdash;An
incision, about four inches in length, commencing a little
above the trochanter, was carried downward along the outer
side of the femur. The lower fragment, for about an inch of
its extent, was cleared of its attachments. An assistant
holding the thigh below, and pushing the bone upward and
outward, so as to bring the fragment through the incision,
about an inch of the bone was then sawed off. The head of
the bone was next dissected from the socket; this part of
the operation was considerably facilitated by an assistant
catching a firm hold of the neck by means of a pair of tooth
forceps, then rotating the head, and using slight force to dislodge
it from the cavity, the operator dividing the capsular
and round ligaments, the latter of which is more easily and
safely divided at the lower and outer side of the articulation.
The upper part of the trochanter was next dissected out, and
several small spiculæ of bone removed. The edges of the
incision were then brought together by sutures, and a bandage
applied. It was not found necessary to tie any vessel,
and there was very little hemorrhage. The man bore the
operation well, and was returned to his bed in good spirits,
and with a good pulse.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Passed a good night; slept pretty well; pulse
106, soft; skin cool; in good spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
11th.&mdash;Slept some hours; pulse 106, soft; bowels open;
tongue furred, but moist. Wound dressed and looking well;
some healthy discharge.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Going on apparently very well; pulse still 106;
countenance good. Vespere: Complains of an increase of
pain in the hip, but otherwise says he feels much as usual;
pulse small and rapid. Ordered wine and arrow-root.</p>

<p>14th.&mdash;Died at six this morning.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed a considerable cavity filled with sanies
in the situation of the operation, but no other fractured bone
was discovered. The articulating surface of the acetabulum
was coated by a fetid, pasty substance.</p>

<p>The following case of wound of the larynx is instructive:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Charles H. Evans, 55th Regiment, aged nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>teen
years, was wounded on the evening of the 5th of August,
1855, about eleven o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, while on duty in the trenches.
The ball entered the right side of the neck, close to the angle
of the jaw, and passed apparently between the hyoid bone
and the arytenoid cartilages, and then downward, having its
exit below the cricoid cartilage on the left side. The pharynx
and larynx were wounded, and the trachea was contused
and displaced. Respiration somewhat hurried; a
quantity of mucus collects in the trachea, and is expectorated
in fits.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the 6th, the respiration becoming
more difficult, with a degree of lividity of the lips,
indicative of the non-oxygenation of the blood, it was
deemed advisable to have recourse to tracheotomy, which,
in consequence of the displacement of the parts and the
swelling, was effected with considerable difficulty. The usual
tubes were found too short for the purpose, and a large silver
catheter was inserted, through which the air passed freely.
Whenever he attempted to drink, the liquid passed into the
trachea through the openings caused by the ball. From
the operation no benefit arose, and he continued very restless
until within an hour of his decease, which took place
about twenty-six hours after the receipt of the wound. The
voice was never heard above a whisper.</p>

<p>Post-mortem examination, twelve hours after death. The
ball would appear to have passed through the hyo-thyroid
membrane, fracturing and shattering the thyroid cartilage.
The membrane lining the glottis was torn and destroyed.
The vessels escaped without injury, the ball having passed
anteriorly.</p>

<p>Deputy Inspector-General Taylor, who was present during
the operation, adds: “The want of a longer tracheal tube
than is commonly supplied for such operations was obvious,
and is a good practical hint. For the first time in my life I
found my two forefingers transfixing a man’s neck from side
to side. The fingers did not cause any cough or irritation,
but those symptoms were occasioned by the least attempt to
swallow water. The thyroid cartilage was separated into
two pieces.”</p>

The following cases, one of wound of the profunda femoris,
the other of the popliteal, deserve attention:&mdash;</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the 14th of August, Private
George Irvine, aged twenty-five, was brought from the
trenches, having been struck by a Minié-ball of the largest
size, which had penetrated the left thigh, about two inches
below Poupart’s ligament, just in the course of the femoral
artery. The ball passed slightly outward, fracturing the
femur, and was cut out at the back of the limb, completely
flattened. As there was considerable hemorrhage, both
venous and arterial, no examination with the finger was
permitted. Dr. Taylor, superintending the Division, having
been informed of the case, a consultation was held.</p>

<p>Amputation at the hip-joint was forbidden by the prostration
of the man, who had lost much blood before he was
brought to camp. Excision of the head of the femur was
also inadmissible, from the evident wound of a large artery,
with probably that of a large vein. Search for the wounded
artery, for the purpose of applying a ligature, was then determined
upon, but before the operation had well proceeded,
the hemorrhage was so great that it was found impossible
to continue it, and pressure by means of graduated compresses
was resorted to, with complete success.</p>

<p>On the following morning an operation was still out of
the question. Prostration continued, with great irritability
of stomach, and a small, quick pulse. No return of hemorrhage,
though the pressure of the tourniquet was but very
slight.</p>

<p>On the 16th, the pulse was more quick and irritable, with
the same irritability of stomach, and urgent thirst. He had
passed a better night, however. At the consultation this
morning, the circulation through the posterior tibial artery
was so evident that the question of the femoral artery being
wounded was set at rest. It was decided, as no return of
hemorrhage had occurred, that the case should be left to
nature.</p>

<p>On the 17th, he suffered from starting pains in the thigh.
There was less irritability of stomach, but the pulse was
very small and weak. During the night there was slight
hemorrhage, owing to his restlessness, but it was easily
arrested by a turn or two of the tourniquet.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 20th, this restlessness increased;
delirium set in, and early in the morning of the 22d he died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
The limb was examined after death, when the following
appearances presented:&mdash;</p>

<p>Femoral artery intact. Femoral vein wounded, with more
than half its caliber shot away. At about two inches from
its origin there was a wound of the profunda artery, on
which an aneurism, nearly the size of a pigeon’s egg, had
formed, and passed upward through the wound made by the
ball. The profunda vein was intact. The injured vessels
having been removed for preservation, the bone was then
cut down upon, when a fracture, nearly transverse, and not
at all comminuted, was observed below the trochanters. No
splitting of bone upward; downward its outer plate was
slightly cracked, but nothing more. The preparation is in
the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>Private James Ross, a lad of eighteen, was brought up
from the trenches, on the morning of the 3d inst., having
had his right leg blown off below the knee by a round shot.
He had lost a very large quantity of blood before the tourniquet
was applied, and was consequently so much collapsed
that an operation was out of the question. He was therefore
dressed and the tourniquets (two had been put on) removed.
He never rallied, and died on the 12th, nine days
after the receipt of the injury. No hemorrhage ever occurred,
though all pressure had been removed from the artery.</p>

<p>The following is worthy of publication, as showing the
successful effects of strychnia, when carried to the extreme
verge of propriety, in injuries of the spinal cord.</p>

<p>Sergeant William Aldridge, 46th Regiment, aged 39 years,
during a sortie from Sebastopol, was knocked down in the
trenches, and his back formed a bridge over which Russians
and English passed. The result was serious injury to the
spine, causing paralysis of the lower extremities and bladder.
The pain was excruciating, and the patient could not
be moved in bed for several weeks.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March, 1855, he was placed under my
charge in the military hospital at Portsmouth, when he
complained of great pain and tenderness along the spine,
and incontinence of urine, together with wandering day
dreams and insomnolency at night. Solution of the muriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
of morphia ʒj was prescribed without any effect. (ʒj contains
1 gr.) The dose was gradually increased to ʒij of the
solution.</p>

<p>15th March.&mdash;Fell out of bed during the night, trying to
hide himself. Is wandering, and fancies that he has deserted
from the Crimea, and will be shot. The narcotic has been
omitted for several days. Strychnia was now ordered, one-sixth
of a grain three times a day.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Continues much the same, with slight twitchings
of the face.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Has been unconscious for three days. Now complains
of intense pain in the back and violent cold perspiration.</p>

<p>28th.&mdash;Returning consciousness; feels easier, having slept
uninterruptedly for forty-eight hours. Expressed a desire to
make his will, and send to Dublin for his wife; both wishes
were complied with.</p>

<p>30th.&mdash;Sensation and motion are gone from the lower extremities,
and the urine is still passed involuntarily. One-eighth
of a grain of strychnia was ordered twice a day.</p>

<p>31st.&mdash;Is powerfully under the influence of the remedy,
with convulsive movements of the upper and lower extremities;
wild stare and fixed jaws. The lower extremities had
not moved for several months previously. This paroxysm
lasted for one hour under my own observation, after which
the muscles became relaxed, the face bedewed with a gentle
perspiration, and resumed its ordinary tranquil appearance.</p>

<p>April 2d.&mdash;Feels greatly relieved from pain, and is comparatively
comfortable; sleeps calmly. His appearance is
entirely changed; looks natural; features calm; is cheerful,
and reads the papers. Strychnia was omitted for some days
after the last paroxysm, and replaced by the tincture of the
sesquichloride of iron with quassia, and a generous diet.</p>

<p>6th.&mdash;Continues to improve. Has now and then slight
twitchings in the legs and arms. The strychnia was resumed
and omitted, as the symptoms indicated, to the end
of the month.</p>

<p>May 1.&mdash;Is greatly improved; goes about the balcony in
a chair. Returning sensation in the right leg. Bladder
still not under the control of the will.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Sensation much improved in both legs, and motion
increasing in the right leg.</p>

<p>25th.&mdash;Convulsive movements all over the body, resulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
from the use of the strychnine. Lower extremities decidedly
improved both in motion and sensation.</p>

<p>June 1st.&mdash;Maintains his improved condition. Recommenced
the strychnine to-day, without any marked effect at
the moment.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Violent tetanic spasms followed the employment
of the remedy, producing considerable increase of motion in
both extremities. The paroxysms <i>usually</i> continue about
fifteen minutes, when the muscular system resumes its ordinary
appearance.</p>

<p>20th.&mdash;Continues the same. Strychnia not resumed since
last entry, as occasional twitchings occur about the head and
face, and he is now affected by the smallest dose.</p>

<p>July 1st.&mdash;General health excellent.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Continues to improve daily in regaining the use
of his limbs. Is now able to walk on the ramparts with
crutches, but is exceedingly sensitive to every change of
weather&mdash;damp always causing pain in the spine. Continued
to improve to the end of the month.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p>The following case of injury of the abdomen, sent to me
by Dr. Rooke, civil surgeon with the army in the field, is
very remarkable:&mdash;</p>

<p>Robert Cousins, aged 20, 77th Regiment, was admitted
into the general hospital, camp, June 8th, with severe injuries
caused by a round shot, which struck him when he was
on duty in the advanced trenches. When the shot struck
him he was standing up, half-face toward the enemy, his
right arm extended in front of the right hip; he was in the
act of reaching his water-can, which rested against the
parapet of the trench.</p>

<p>On admission he was in a state of semi-collapse, the integuments
of the right hand and forearm greatly lacerated,
the wrist-joint laid open, the bones of the carpus comminuted;
the radius and ulna were also fractured at the middle
third. There was a lacerated wound in the right iliac region,
the size of the palm of the hand; over this space the
skin and muscles of the abdominal wall were torn away, the
peritoneum lining it was also lacerated, and at the bottom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
of the wound was seen a coil of intestine in situ; there was
no tendency to protrusion, nor were its coats at all injured.
The crest and body of the ilium were much comminuted, the
fracture extending downward between the anterior superior
and anterior inferior spinous processes. The anterior superior
spinous process was broken off. There was another
wound just below the great trochanter; this apophysis was
also shattered. The right limb was two inches shorter than
its fellow, the foot everted, but, from the great comminution
of the pelvis and the extreme pain produced by examination,
it was not satisfactorily made out that the neck of the femur
was fractured, but the shortening of the limb and eversion
of the foot were in favor of that diagnosis. The injuries
which the patient had received were considered mortal; it
was thought unnecessary cruelty to amputate the forearm.
Such pieces of the ilium as were loose were removed; wet
lint applied to the wounds; and brandy and water with
opiates were ordered. One of his comrades volunteered to
watch over him, and he was left, as all thought, to die. The
next day (June 9th) he had partially rallied from the state
of collapse; had taken liquid nourishment&mdash;beef-tea, arrow-root,
etc. There was no pain or tenderness of the abdomen;
had passed his water without difficulty. The surface
of the abdominal wound was sloughy; intestine still visible;
complains of pain in the arm. It was not yet considered
advisable to perform any operation. He was ordered opium
gr. j every four hours; also a dose of morphia at night,
arrow-root, beef-tea, and port wine, which he prefers to
brandy.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;Has rallied completely; no pain or tenderness of
the abdomen; complains greatly of his arm, and is anxious
that something should be done. He slept well after taking
the morphia; his face is tranquil, breathing natural, pulse
weak; no irritability. Deputy Inspector-General Taylor
saw the case in consultation with Dr. Mouat, P. M. O. of
the hospital. It was decided to amputate the forearm. This
was done at the upper third; chloroform was administered,
and produced no ill effects. He was ordered any fluid nourishment
he might fancy, with port wine, and an opiate at
night.</p>

<p>11th.&mdash;No symptoms of peritonitis; suffers no pain;
tongue clean and moist; pulse quiet; passes his water regularly;
the bowels have not acted. The abdomen is quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
soft and fallen, not the slightest tenderness on pressure. To
continue on the same plan. He could now give some account
of the way in which he was wounded. He stated that
he thought it must have been a round shot that struck him.
It first struck his arm, then entered the right iliac region,
emerging at the lower wound. The surface of the wound in
the iliac region is in a sloughy state from the severe bruising
of the parts. The coil of intestine is still visible at the
bottom of the wound.</p>

<p>12th.&mdash;No symptoms of peritonitis; bowels have not
acted; tenderness down the outside of the thigh, with redness
of the skin, and pitting upon pressure. Stump dressed
to-day and looking well.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;No unfavorable constitutional symptoms. The
outer part of the thigh is tender and the skin red; free incisions
were made; the fascia was sloughy. He takes nourishment;
has eight ounces of port wine daily, eggs, arrow-root,
and essence of beef. Bowels not acted.</p>

<p>21st.&mdash;He had no symptoms worthy of remark since the
13th. The bowels have not been moved; he complained
to-day of not being able to pass his motions. Two injections
of warm water were administered in the course of the
day. He passed a large quantity of hardened feces, which
relieved him greatly. The sloughs are separating from the
incisions in the thigh; the crest and ala of the ilium are exposed;
healthy granulations are springing up from the bottom
of the wound. Stump healing favorably.</p>

<p>July 26.&mdash;The case has progressed without a bad symptom.
At first it was thought that the greater part of the ala
of the ilium would exfoliate, but some red points appeared
on the surface, and the concavity of the bone became covered
with granulations. The exfoliation was limited to the anterior
part of the crest of the ilium, which separated on the
17th instant. At various times pieces of bone have been
removed as they became detached; there are others still left
to come away. The granulations on the upper wound are
on a level with the skin of the abdomen. The crest of the
ilium is covered with granulations; the wound is contracting,
but there is a deficiency of skin to cover the projecting
portion of the ilium. The lower wound is also open, and
has been enlarged to remove pieces of bone; the incisions
in the thigh have healed. The bowels have acted regularly
without medicines until to-day, when he required a castor-oil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
injection. The right thigh is more than two inches shorter
than the left; union appears to have taken place; he has
no pain on motion. The dead bone that still remains alone
prevents the wounds from closing, their surfaces being covered
with healthy granulations. His general health is good.
He has taken at intervals some oleum jecoris aselli, and, for
a mild attack of bronchitis under which he suffered at the
end of June, expectorants and diaphoretics. There has not
been a single symptom of any abdominal complication. He
has an opiate at night. The stump has been healed nearly
three weeks.</p>

<p>September 14th.&mdash;Since the last report no unfavorable
symptoms have occurred. The stump of the forearm has
been healed some weeks; his health is good; indeed, from
first to last, he has not had a single symptom denoting constitutional
disturbance. All the dead bone from the crest
of the ilium has separated; the wound of the abdomen is
skinned over, with the exception of a small spot about the
size of a sixpence. This is healthy, and is gradually healing.
The bowels act regularly. There are still two sinuses on the
outer side of the thigh&mdash;one above, the other below, the
great trochanter. On probing these, dead bone is felt, which
has not yet separated. The right limb is about three inches
shorter than the left, is freely movable in any direction without
pain. He can raise the knee from the pillow, but cannot
lift the heel from the bed; he can, however, turn himself
over on to the left side without assistance. The prominence
of the crest of the ilium is greatly diminished from loss of
bone. The trochanter major is unusually projecting; the
natural appearance of the hip-joint is entirely gone. The
injuries to the bones have been so severe, it is difficult to say
what changes have occurred. The ilium and pubis have
been greatly comminuted, the fracture most probably extending
through the acetabulum. Immediately below Poupart’s
ligament, to the outside of the femoral artery, a hard
substance is felt beneath the skin. This, when he was admitted,
was at first supposed to have been a piece of a shell,
but it is now thought to be a portion of the pubis driven
downward upon the thigh.</p>

<p>He may now be said to be convalescent.</p>

<p>John Shehan, aged nineteen, 57th Regiment, was wounded
in the left thigh before the Redan, on the 18th of June. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
was brought to the general hospital, and placed under the
charge of a gentleman of considerable skill and experience.
The wound presented two openings, an anterior and a posterior;
the latter offered greater facilities for examination
than the former; the finger, passed from behind, detected
several fragments, which were removed, and as a tolerably
uniform surface of bone (<i>vide</i> specimen) was then felt, it was
determined, after consultation, to make an attempt to save
the limb. The injured extremity was accordingly bound up
with a long splint in the most careful manner, and matters
promised favorably for a time. He, however, complained of
a good deal of suffering in the limb from time to time, gradually
wasted, suffered from diarrhœa, and finally sank on the
6th of August. On examination post-mortem, I found the
chief organs in a normal condition. There was some congestion
of the ilium, and the colon presented a few points of
ulceration. The condition of the parts in the left lower extremity
was very remarkable. Beneath the integuments, all
the muscular and other textures, from the seat of injury to
the groin, were converted into a soft, broken-down, black,
rotten mass; and I may here observe that this low but intense
disorganizing process, extending through the greater
part of the limb, has presented itself in several of my examinations
of somewhat similar injuries, and appears to me to
be connected with <i>a peculiar pathological state in which all
the vital organs remain sound, but the vis vitæ is remarkably
reduced below par</i>. The fractured bone it is unnecessary
to describe. The vertical and cross infraction of the
fragments and its almost “arborescent” appearance are most
remarkable. I look upon it as a specimen of no ordinary
value, conveying more than one most useful lesson. The
bones are in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>July 12, five <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>&mdash;Carried into hospital, wounded by a
splinter of shell in left elbow and on left hip. The splinter
struck him in an oblique direction, from behind, fracturing
olecranon process and internal condyle of humerus, lacerating
and otherwise injuring the joint, the ulnar nerve being
also injured. The splinter continuing its onward course,
inflicted a lacerated wound on the hip, with comminuted
fracture of about the anterior fifth of the crest of the ilium,
several small pieces of bone being driven in on the peritoneum,
causing pain on the slightest motion. All the loose
portions of bone were removed, and several others separated
from the muscles. Abdomen painful, and swollen at that
side. Abdomen continued painful during the day; bowels
acted; he also passed water freely.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;Pain in abdomen much less; little, if any, constitutional
disturbance; elbow extremely painful; the pain
accompanied with partial paralysis of the little and ring fingers.
Staff-Surgeon Dr. Gordon having seen him, and not
apprehending any danger from the wound in the side, the
operation for excision of the elbow-joint was determined on,
and performed under chloroform, by a single straight incision
passing through the original wound, including the upper and
lower fourths of the forearm and arm. There was very
little hemorrhage. The arm was then put up in an angular
splint. It continued to progress favorably, the greater part
healing by the first intention. There was some suppuration,
but a free exit being given to the matter, it did not retard
recovery.</p>

<p>Private Anthony Murray, aged twenty-eight, 41st Regiment,
a healthy man, was struck, while on duty in the trenches
before Sebastopol, on the night of the 23d of July, 1855, by
a portion of a shell, which penetrated the left elbow-joint;
the head of the radius and the outer half of the articulating
surface of the humerus were comminuted, fragments being
impacted in the cancelous structure of the humerus, and
driven in between that bone and the ulna. Excision of the
joint having been determined on, it was performed in the following
manner: a straight incision was made along the posterior
surface of the joint, the olecranon cut through, and the
extremities of the several bones removed in succession; the
parts were then brought together by suture, and the limb
placed in a flexed position; about a third of the wound healed
by the first intention; no inflammation supervened. On the
3d of August the wound was granulating in a healthy manner;
on the 22d, it had almost healed, and the limb was put
up permanently, the forearm at right angles to the arm; on
the 31st, some union had taken place between the bones;
the man can move the thumb and three fingers; he is free
from pain; his health is very good, and he appears to be
progressing favorably in every respect.</p>

<p>Private Jesse Lockhurst, 31st Regiment, aged twenty-six,

1855.</p>

<p>August 17th.&mdash;Six o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, carried into regimental
hospital, having received an extensive lacerated wound of
right cheek: very little apparent hemorrhage, but the power
of deglutition was completely lost, and respiration impeded.
On making an examination of the wound, it was ascertained
that the right superior maxillary bone was fractured, and a
portion of the hard palate with the molar teeth driven in on
the tongue; there was a large piece of shell or shot lodged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
at the bottom of the wound, lying on left palate, and, as far
as could be ascertained, on the back of pharynx. Staff-Surgeon
Dr. Gordon being present, the ball, after much labor,
was extracted, and found to be a grape-shot of seventeen and
a half ounces weight. During the operation it was found
necessary to dilate the wound by dividing the lip near its
external angle&mdash;the portions of bone that were removed
were the alveolar process, with all the molar teeth, including
part of the palate and a portion of the orbital plate and
nasal process of the superior maxillary bone, and all the
malar bone. There was no serious hemorrhage during the
operation, nor immediately after the extraction of the shot.
The cheek was then plugged with lint and the wound brought
into apposition by sutures. The man experienced immediate
relief after the operation, sat up in bed, washed out his
mouth, and drank some water; he seemed extremely thankful,
and blessed the doctors. During the night and part of
the next day there was some oozing from the mouth. No
bad symptom occurred until the 20th, when an active hemorrhage
came on from the back of the palate. The exact
source could not be ascertained. He became very weak and
almost pulseless; but the hemorrhage was eventually restrained
by means of ice and plugging the wound with lint
moistened in tincture of matico. Iced drinks occasionally.</p>

<p>31st.&mdash;The man is now doing extremely well, can talk,
and takes a pint of jelly daily; the external wound is not
yet quite healed, in consequence of the saliva flowing
through it. The right eye is uninjured, and sight unaffected.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 24th, Private Francis O’Brien,
a lad of eighteen, was brought from the trenches, with a
wound from a musket-ball in the right temple. It entered
about two inches above the orbit, passed downward, and
drove out a large portion of the supra-orbital ridge, which
appeared to be imbedded in the upper eyelid, and was cut
down upon by the medical officer in the trenches, in mistake
for the ball, which it certainly very much resembled. As no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
ball could be found, it was supposed to have passed out at
the opening of entrance.</p>

<p>The finger when passed into the wound could feel the
pulsation of the brain, yet from that day to the present no
symptom of cerebral disturbance has appeared, unless it be
that since his convalescence the muscles of the face work
convulsively when he feels faint and weak from remaining
too long in the erect posture. About a month after admission,
the detached portion of the bone above the orbit was
removed from the eyelid, though with considerable difficulty,
and on the following morning the ball fell from the wound,
much to the poor lad’s horror, who thought his eye had
dropped out.</p>

<p>Both wounds have now healed, but he is unable to raise
the right eyelid; the eye is perfect, but apparently without
power of vision, though sensible to the stimulus of light,
for on turning the wounded side to the light, the left pupil
contracts. His general health is good.</p>

<p>Private Michael Caffrey, 88th Regiment, wounded at the
attack upon the Redan on the 8th of September, was brought
to the hospital of the 38th Regiment on the morning of the
9th. A round rifle-ball struck him at the anterior part of
the left parietal bone, and passed through the brain in a line
which brought it out at the vertex, fracturing the parietal
bone of the opposite side; the ball at its entrance split, and
one-half pushing before it a small piece of bone, both lodged
at the entrance; the other half of the ball was found lodged
in the brain at the upper and back part, having detached a
circular portion of the skull.</p>

<p>A director was passed along the track of the wound, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
the scalp laid open; the brain was found to protrude through
the fracture. In this condition the patient lived for eleven
days, utterly unconscious of everything passing around him,
the urine and feces coming away involuntarily. There was
paralysis of the opposite side.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination showed the brain to have
been reduced to a pultaceous mass only in the direction of
the passage of the missile; the remaining portion of the

<p>Private William Doyle, 19th Regiment, aged nineteen
years, was wounded in the head by a rifle-ball, in the advanced
trench of the right attack, on August the 30th.
The scalp and pericranium were cut about two inches, and
a portion of the cranium, a little in advance of the posterior
and superior angle of the right parietal bone, close to the
sagittal suture, about an inch in length and half an inch in
breadth, was depressed. According to statement the man
was rendered perfectly senseless and motionless, from the instant
of being struck by the bullet. On reaching camp he
presented all the usual symptoms indicating compression;
pupils dilated and fixed, warm surface, total unconsciousness,
complete paralysis, etc. On examination of the depressed
portion of bone, no opening whatever could be felt; the
edges of the sunk bone and the bone adjoining were in contact,
and it was presumed to be an ordinary case of fracture
with depression simply. Some very minute portions of cerebral
substance were observed to be mixed with the clot of
blood about the wound, such as might be squeezed through
a fissure. Trephining being determined on, it was performed
at once, and the depressed bone raised without difficulty.
No relief of symptoms followed. The dura mater bulged
slightly upward into the opening. On passing the finger
over its surface, a little beyond the space exposed by the
trephine, a defined cut edge was felt about an inch in
ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>vance
of the depressed piece of bone, being the boundary of
an opening into the cerebral substance.</p>

<p>Three hours after arrival in camp the patient died. On
examination post-mortem, a wedge-like section of the ball
was found to have entered and penetrated the cerebral substance;
it was discovered in the anterior lobe on the right
side, just above the orbitar plate. It had not completely
penetrated, but was lying just above the membrane covering
the lobe. The ball&mdash;a conical rifle-ball with three cannelures&mdash;was
cut smoothly from apex to base, as if by a sharp
knife. This must have been done by the edge of broken
bone above the opening made in the parietal bone, one-half
of the ball flying off, the other entering the skull. On close
examination, several very small points of lead were found to
be imbedded along the margin of the bone alluded to. The
depressed portion of bone, directly after the piece of ball
entered, must have sprung up again by its own resiliency,
or been forced up by sudden pressure from within, so that
no evidence of an aperture, but merely a fissure and depression
remained. The inner table was separated, and
nearly detached, for a space rather more extensive than that
of the depressed part of the outer table. The superior
longitudinal sinus was wounded by the sharp edge of the
broken inner table, and a very considerable quantity of
blood extravasated upon the surface of the brain.</p>

preserved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="REMARKS">REMARKS.</h2>

<p>Six amputations at the hip-joint (if not more) have been
performed in the Crimea, and all the sufferers have died, a
loss which has not been experienced in civil life under any
circumstances, many persons having survived the operation
for years. It has been fairly attributed to the depressing
causes from which the army suffered, and for which the
government has been blamed; although the great functionaries
appear to me to have less to account for than their
subordinates, as far as regards deficiencies in the treatment
of the sick and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
The operation for removing the head of the femur from
its connection with the hip, leaving the limb for future use,
was first recommended by me as a substitute for amputation
at the hip-joint, and has been done in at least six instances,
one only surviving. I limited the operation to injuries of
the head and neck of the bone, or with little extension beyond
these two parts, being cases which hitherto invariably
died unless amputation at the hip-joint were performed, and
which it was and is hoped the operation of excision might
render unnecessary; but it must be done under happier circumstances,
and perhaps with greater restriction. The success
which has followed the removal of the head of the
humerus from the shoulder-joint even with as much as one-third
of the shaft, as low as the insertion of the deltoid
muscle, has led to the belief that as much may be done in
the thigh; and in the hope that it might be so, a considerable
portion of the shaft of the femur has been removed with
the head and neck in the cases alluded to, so that an approximation
of the remainder of the shaft to the cavity of
the joint has not been possible. If the operation performed
by Surgeon O’Leary, 68th Regiment, (page 564,) which at
the end of seven weeks is reported as doing well, although
the pulse remained between 80 and 100, should succeed, it
is doubtful whether the limb will be of any use or better
than an artificial leg, from the extent of the bone removed,
which will prevent the formation of a firm joint or union.
The sling used in this case has been considered very advantageous
by all who have seen the man, and proves how much
may be done in all cases of compound fractures by similar
appliances, but which has not yet been done. A correct
judgment cannot, however, be formed as to the value of this
operation until it has been performed on one of those cases
in which a ball shall simply lodge in the head or neck of the
femur without injuring the shaft of the bone&mdash;an accident
which has been so frequently observed in the head of the
humerus, and of which I have sent two preparations to the
museum of the College of Surgeons. (See page 127.)</p>

<p>It has been already stated that the loss of life after amputations
performed for gunshot fractures of the upper part
of the thigh has been so great, both in the French and
English armies, that such operations have been nearly abandoned.</p>

<p>The Russians, at the commencement of the siege of
Sebas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>topol,
made use of a conical rifle bullet, flat at the base,
weighing nearly one ounce and three-quarters. Latterly
they have used a larger conical one, with three grooves
around the circumference of the base of the cone, which is
hollowed out to receive a cup, and shows a projection on
the inside of the hollow. This ball is near two inches
long, and weighs somewhat more than one ounce and three-quarters.</p>

<p>The balls formerly used by the French army were twenty
to the pound, and by the English, sixteen. The balls alluded
to are nine to the pound. When this Russian ball strikes
soft parts only, such as the thigh, it merely makes a larger
hole than the common bullet, into which the finger passes
easily, and the wound heals as readily. Whenever it strikes
a bone, it would appear to break it more extensively, and to
require more certainly the amputation of the limb; although
the smaller French ball used in former days, when it struck
a bone, disabled the sufferer as effectually for all future
service, yet it might not as certainly lead to his death.</p>

<p>Dr. Lyons not only transmitted to me the case, related
page 579, of John Shehan, but has since sent me the broken
bones, which confirm everything I have said on this subject,
page 321. The sound bone above the fracture has become
more solid; the splinters not having been removed are lying
across, and prevent the approximation or union of the ends
of the old bone, while the effort made by nature to effect
this object by the deposition of new ossific matter, adds to
the evil by fixing these splinters in so solid a manner that
they cannot escape or be removed by any other means than
that of forcible abstraction, after painful and perhaps dangerous
operations, each splinter possibly requiring a separate
one. Shehan’s case was one for amputation from the
first, if he had been in a state to undergo it with a prospect
of success.</p>

<p>The treatment of gunshot fractures of the leg ought to
have been more successful than it has been, even when both
bones were broken; the want of success may be in part
attributed to the remissness which has taken place in supplying
the necessary, nay, the essential appliances, by means
of which much suffering might have been alleviated, perhaps
prevented, even if cures could not have been effected.</p>

<p>In performing the operation for the excision of portions
of the extremities of bones, a chain saw is a most desirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
aid on many occasions. There was not one with the British
army in the Crimea, and when wanted, they were borrowed
from the French ambulances. It was only on the 30th of
September last some were ordered to be sent out, and they
cannot yet have arrived. In a lecture I delivered on the
14th of April last in the Theater of the College of Surgeons,
as its President, by permission of the Council, the
proceeding being unusual, I drew attention, for the express
purpose, to the necessity which existed for the Crimean
army being supplied with a machine capable of being moved
from bed to bed, by means of which the unfortunate soldier
could be raised in the extended state, and after being
washed, his wounds dressed, and his bedclothes changed, he
might be again laid down with comparatively little uneasiness.
Fifty of them would not cost £300, but there are
none in the Crimea, except two, one sent to the Coldstream
Guards, by Lord Strafford at his own expense, and one
which the makers placed at my disposal. I hear that <i>three</i>
have been ordered lately, like the chain saw, when too late,
for many are now no more who stood in the greatest need of
them, and without which machine they had little chance of
being saved.</p>

<p>On the 14th of April, 1855, I published a lecture, in which
I gave a sketch of an apparatus for slinging a broken leg,
which instrument I declared to be a <i>sine qua non</i> in the
successful treatment of a gunshot fracture of the leg. By
permission of the Duke of Newcastle, I sent out forty-six
sets complete for every part of the body, the year preceding.
They were, I am told, left at Varna; and four medical officers,
of character and knowledge, who have lately returned
from the East, assure me within the last week that no such,
or any similarly useful, apparatus was ever seen in the hospitals
in front of Sebastopol. Other instances of remissness
of equal importance might be adduced, if it were not useless
to advert to them; for we delight, I believe, in being admitted
by foreigners to be a wonderful people in the mismanagement
of our affairs in the first instance, however important
or trivial. It is, I believe, an admitted maxim, that
the right men should be in the right place&mdash;the square ones
in the square holes, the round ones in the round holes; but
there is another one of equal importance, viz., that the
right thing should be in the right place at the right time,
without which teaching or practicing surgery becomes of
little value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
Amputation at the knee-joint has been done, I hear, in
six cases since the taking of Sebastopol; four are dead; one
is doing well under Mr. Blenkins, of the Guards, and the
other yet survives. Excision of the knee-joint has been
performed since the taking of Sebastopol in one case by
Staff-Surgeon Lakin, and is doing well.</p>

<p>The excisions performed on the head of the humerus, and
on the bones composing the elbow-joint, have been very successful.
There is, however, a circumstance to which I am
desirous of drawing attention, viz., that the head of the
humerus should never be removed in amputations, when it
is uninjured, however close the destruction below may have
approached it. The round head of bone left in the socket
preserves the squareness of the shoulder, and renders the
loss of the arm less unseemly. It tends to prevent the inclination
the body generally has to the opposite side, and its
being left adds nothing to the difficulties of the operation.
The excisions of the ankle-joint have been numerous and
more successful than might have been expected under the
depressing causes alluded to.</p>

<p>For the preparations of the head of the humerus and of
the astragalus, referred to at pages 110 and 128, I have since
learned I am indebted to Deputy Inspector-General Macgregor;
and I am particularly so to Assistant-Surgeon
Gregg, of the 17th Regiment, for the great care he has
bestowed on several of the specimens of injury sent to me.</p>

<p>Wounds penetrating the cavities of the chest and abdomen
have been no less fatal than those of the lower extremities.
The same want of power has been exhibited in them;
the same inability to bear the means of cure which, under
happier circumstances, have proved successful.</p>

<p>I hope to receive reports on wounds of arteries, on
secondary hemorrhage, and on injuries of the head, so as to
enable me to remove any doubts which may exist on these
points; and I beg to assure those officers who will favor me
with their opinions and facts, that they shall be duly reported
in another “Addenda.”</p>

<p>I cannot conclude these remarks without expressing my
sense of the great practical ability displayed by very many
of the medical officers in the Crimea, of their devotion, of
their self-denial&mdash;qualities which ought to obtain for them
the special approbation of the nation.</p>

<p>It would be useless
for us to attempt a review
of this work, for
the text is so fully illustrated
by engravings,
and is so intimately
associated with
them, that we cannot
extract any part as a
sample of the style,
without weakening its
force, for the want of
its accompanying illustration.
The book
must be read and studied before an adequate idea can be formed of its
value and excellence. The book comes from such high authority, and is
indorsed by such competent judges, as to make it at once indispensable to
the student of microscopic anatomy. We hope it will have an extensive
circulation.&mdash;<i>Western Lancet.</i></p>

<p>The reputation of Professor Kolliker, acquired by his former and larger
work on microscopical anatomy, will be enhanced by this text book on
Histology, for such it is destined to be pre eminently. The text is fully
illustrated by engravings, greatly adding to the value of the work, and
accompanied by explicit explanations of the figures. We commend it to
the profession, and to students especially, as worthy of their patronage.&mdash;<i>N.

<p>Malgaigne’s Treatise has enjoyed

such well-deserved renown, that
we must own to a feeling of surprise
at learning that before the
appearance of the present work
no attempt has been made to present
so popular an author in an
English dress. The present book,
a contribution to our literature
from America, is the work of a
gentleman whose name is not otherwise known to us, and is one which we can
conscientiously pronounce very valuable.... A very useful book indeed,
and one which we hope will have an extensive circulation.&mdash;<i>British and
Foreign Med. Chir. Review.</i></p>

<p>Must be regarded as a monument, conspicuous and to be admired, even
among the noble monuments of the medical literature of his [the author’s]
country. As a solid, complete, substantial, highly-finished work, we know
of none that is its superior; it can, with justice, be regarded as a model in
scientific literature.&mdash;<i>North American Med. Chir. Rev.</i></p>

<p>It affords us sincere pleasure to be able to welcome the appearance, in
an English dress, of this valuable treatise. The annotations which Dr.
Packard has appended to it are numerous, and appear to us to be of much
practical value, adapting, as they do, the treatment of fractures to the
generally received and most approved American methods.&mdash;<i>Journal of the

Medica. By <span class="smcap">Geo. B. Wood</span>, M.D., Professor of the Theory

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In his preface Dr. Wood gives the following account of his opportunities
for acquiring knowledge and forming just views on the subjects embraced
in this treatise:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Almost from the commencement of his professional life the author has
given peculiar attention to this branch of medical knowledge. For a
period of about thirty years, before 1850, when he was transferred to the
professorship which he now occupies, he was engaged in teaching materia
medica, first as a private lecturer, and afterwards successively in the Philadelphia
College of Pharmacy and the University of Pennsylvania. His
position, therefore, rendered constant investigations into the properties,
effects, and uses of remedies necessary in order at once to do justice
to his pupils and avoid discredit to himself. Most of those whom he
now addresses are probably aware that he is one of the authors of the
United States Dispensatory. To provide the original materials for his
portion of that work, and to gather from time to time the knowledge
requisite for its maintenance upon a level with the progressive condition
of medical science, unremitting diligence was essential in prosecuting inquiry
and investigation in the whole field of pharmacology. In addition
to the ordinary professional opportunities, he has for about twenty years
held the office of one of the physicians of the Pennsylvania Hospital,
which has given him facilities for testing the value of remedies greater
than any amount of private practice could afford. Few persons have had
greater advantages or stronger inducements than himself for acquiring the
knowledge requisite for the production of a work of this kind.”</p>

of which he considers entitled to a place in a work on the diseases of the
infant race. The large addition of matter thus made to the work has

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
